Welcome to my Santa Teresa Costa Rica travel vlog. My boyfriend Albion, I just spent 10 days exploring Santa Teresa in the surrounding towns. Here I'm going to share with you the best beaches, restaurants, activities, places we stay there and more. Let's get into it. To get to Santa Teresa, first fly into San Jose, then take a small plane from San Jose to Cabano. The ride over is beautiful and it's a lot of fun. Once you land in Cabano from there to attack see two Santa Teresa. This was the first place we stayed at in Santa Teresa called Buena Onda Bungalos, located on the north end of town. We loved it here. It was only a quick walk to the beach, very clean with everything we needed and the staff were super friendly. We also had a gated area to park our ATV which was cool. I highly recommend staying here. The sun sets don't miss a sunset way in Santa Teresa. Everybody from town goes and every night is so special and different. Give yourself some time tips for the small fishing village of Malpais. It's okay to just sell this Santa Teresa. It's very quiet with the most beautiful colored water. We love exploring this area. We found these sad pools one morning leaving our Airbnb heading to Plya Hermosa. We noticed a few people hanging out in them so we decided to check them out. It's the perfect spot for snorkeling or just relaxing in the ocean. At the right tide the pools were very calm with the waves breaking on the outside of the rocks. We didn't have our snorkel here but we saw bright blue fish and even an eel. Be sure to rent an ATV for your time in Santa Teresa. It's a perfect way to get around. We use ours every single day and we're able to explore so many places with it. We felt very safe and just be sure to always have sunglasses because it does get dusty. This is a must-do activity while you're here. Book the sunset beach tour with Horizonte experience. Michelle the owner is amazing. She'll take you through the village, the jungle on the beach, through a river and even have you galloping by the end. Those are my favorite things we did on our trip. Antrochis aursis really loved us. We did a day trip out to Tortuga Island. Our days started off with the zoom tours picking us up in Santa Teresa. They drove us across to Montezuma. In Montezuma we got a boat and headed towards Tortuga Island. We made some stops, a snorkel, saw some really beautiful fish, we saw a shark. They dropped us off on the island. We had an amazing lunch, played beach volleyball with the locals. We met a lot of cool new people, explored the island and that's in the day. They brought us back and then back all the way to Santa Teresa. The staff were great. I would highly recommend doing the same zoom tours. If you're looking for nightlife in Santa Teresa, so most on a Thursday night is the place to be. Jackalops is a surf shop that plies her most up beach, which is the more beginner friendly beach. We went to surfboards from them and we could also do lessons. I highly recommend going with them. They offer great prices, $15 to the day. You can walk back after and jump it off when you're done with the beach. It's a great little surf shop. Vista de Olas is a hotel up higher on a mountain that overlooks Santa Teresa beach. We went over and got some food and drinks, which covered our feet and used the pool. We hung out a little before sunset and stayed until the sun went down. It was the coolest spot to watch overlooking the whole beach in town. I highly recommend spending some time up here one night. It just gives you a totally new perspective of the sunset. This was the second place we see that in Santa Teresa just down the road from the other. So still on the north side of town. This is called Hotel Raratanga in apartments. We really like this place. It felt super quiet, clean. The people were all really nice at work there. We had our own little kitchen, bedroom, living space that can hang out in the bathroom. We had a place to park our ATV. We had a gate to walk everything. There was a cute little kitty that hung out. We really like this bar. I highly recommend. We left Santa Teresa really one morning and drove past Montezuma to the Cabo Blanco Nature Preserve. We saw some animals and did the mediums as hike. Afterwards we drove back to Montezuma, where we hiked up the Montezuma waterfall. Make sure not to wear regular sneakers. You want to wear teavis or some sort of water shoe. The falls are beautiful and so cool to see in person. We stopped for lunch in town after and explored Montezuma a little bit. It's a totally different vibe than Santa Teresa. The drive from Santa Teresa to Montezuma is so fun, especially on ATV. We're going to have a look at the view from the top of the mountain.
