Costa Rica, nature's ultimate playground. From a job-robbing landscape to one of a kind while life encounters, this wonderland destination seems to have it all. But is it really all it's cracked up to be? Or did it crowd an expensive price to make it an overrated tourist trap? Let's find out. So this behind me is the entrance to what is said to be the best national park in all of Costa Rica. It's 7 a.m. right now. We came early. We're gonna see what we can spot. Costa Rica is home to 5% of all biodiversity on our planet. And here in Manuel Antonio National Park, you can spot 109 different types of mammals and up to 200 bird species. And that's why we're here to see wildlife. I was looking for a monkey and almost tripped over to see what on that. How close this. It's a monkey. It's a monkey. I get some monkey. What a way to start off this day. We started to wonder, was this just beginners luck or is Costa Rica truly this good for wildlife all around? Oh my god. There's deer. There's deer with babies right here. She has babies. Oh, there's some mom with babies coming right onto the... It's cute. This is like bamboo in real life. This is just incredible all the wildlife we've seen. It's just been here for like 45 minutes. There's no zoo. This is an actual national park. This is wild. These are wild animals. We don't even have a guide. These are just the things we've been able to spot by ourselves. Wow. This is to keep the monkeys out. One big downside of a park is that you're not allowed to bring in any food at all. And you're not allowed to bring in any drinks in single-use plastics. So only if you refillable ball you can bring in some water. But they'll happily sell you water at $5 for a small ball of water. And for a small coffin. So it's now about 9.30 in the morning. And you can clearly tell that there are large groups of tourists and visitors coming in. I can see him hanging. I can see his head. I can see him moving. Very slow. It's really slow. This is not slow motion footage. This is just a slow motion. This is just a slow motion. I haven't been able to spot one by myself. There were like three or four groups of people out pointing to one tree. So yeah. Kind of with a giveaway. I love this. I can actually not find one. I can't. It's actually really rare to see a sloth moving. They stay up in that tree for just about a week. And then at the end of the week, they have to, which is Sunday, it's the end of the week. They have to go to the bathroom and they have to come down. That is also when 50% of sloth deaths happen because they either fall from the tree or they're more vulnerable to predators. Okay, so Costa Rica really is good for wildlife. In fact, it's pretty fantastic. Just a few trees down from the first sloth. We spotted a family of sloths. This is the dad. And this, Verbal, is the mom and baby. You can see the baby's head. It's the one on the left. You can just see him looking down. And a few moments later, we were surrounded by about a dozen monkeys. There's literally like ten monkeys around right now. They're walking across the path here. They're jumping through the trees. We're being chased away by the monkeys. Let's get out of here. A couple weeks ago, we met some travelers who had just been in Costa Rica. They had planned to stay for two weeks, but ended up leaving after only four days, because of the crowds and the prices, which made us wonder just how bad would things get as we hit up some of the highlights of Costa Rica. Over these next few days, we're going to find out. For lunch, we drove to a spot of a few kilometers down the road from the National Park. Wow, guys. The views here. This is really something else. That over there is actually my route. I'm going on the National Park. You can see there. We each had a fruit juice. We had some fish. This is lovely procable and a slice of pie with some coffee. It was a delicious meal and it cost us about 70 US dollars. Views included. One thing a lot of people complain about and really dislike about Costa Rica are the prices, especially prices of tours and restaurants and food. A lunch wasn't cheap. It was more European or US prices. We definitely can't afford that every day. Over the next couple of days, we're going to see if we can find some affordable things to do, some affordable tours and some affordable local food. Maybe we're going to have to sell one kidney each? We both have two, so we have plenty of kidneys. I like this. Here's one inside the brick box, this is not called gambling money. Gear Fun Gotta intuitive. Gear Fun Gotta have an incentive. We can be able to enjoy some poor food while out on our left. The big fish truck is a chief port. Because I think you can rent a kayak here on the beach for like 20-ish box. So we have our own kayak. So this is very affordable. So a beautiful little bay. It's incredible. Uda-vida. Uda-vida. There is a small little park here. Little playground. There are lots of people out and about. So obviously we're going to be spending the night inside of our van. Sleeping inside the van. And this part of Costa Rica has a bit of a safety issue. If you look on my overlander there are a bunch of these red little icons along the coast which indicate that people who've tried to spend the night here or park here have had issues. We even read of a guy who was held up at gunpoint. They were trying to rob him. He refused to give up his stuff and he ended up getting shot. So I hope he can find something here around the park. Because it looks like a nice little area. And when he's done, he made it. Food and night. You want to know? Really ended up sleeping. The park here is over there and right down the street here is the police station. That's the police station of the town. We parked up right in front of it. That seemed like the very safest spot you could be. So today we're going to be driving to another highlight of Costa Rica. Known for its action. Action! We are going to go zip lining. This is roughly the route that we took down from Mexico to Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua. And right now we've come to Costa Rica. Yesterday we were at Manuel Antonio and today we're going to drive up the coast. This way to Monteverde National Park. We just parked the car here off the road. There is something very special to be spotted here. And best of all, it's free. I can see one. I can see one over there. I can see you. No. Oh that's a big boy. So we're now at Croc d'Albridge. This river literally has hundreds of crocodiles. It's actually the most polluted river in all of Costa Rica. You can just get right off the highway, stare over bridge into the water, and there's this whole family of crocodiles. I'm very surprised they're not eating that bird over there. It's just chilling right next to a croc and it's like, as I walk through the valley of the shadow of the devil. Now I have to say this is really cool, but I was sort of coming here with the expectation of seeing dozens of crocodiles because that's what it was like in the pictures and in the videos that I had seen. It just goes to show though how crazy it is to have certain expectations because this is so cool. But because of what I saw, mom, I'm like, yeah, but I think cooler if there were more. See you later alligator. We continue driving towards Monteverde National Park, leaving the coast behind. In an attempt to stop Costa Rica from bleeding a stride of all our savings, we opted for a local favorite for lunch. For lunch today, we're going to try something different. Fried chicken is super, super popular in general and central America, and it is probably one of the most affordable meals you can get. Really? How much was it? Well, I'll show you what I have. Mucho tortillas, and then I have about six fairly large pieces of chicken breast. It's actually pretty good. So how much was it? How much do you think it was? Which is $20. It was $3,600 colonis. That is really affordable. No, that's a deal. Local prices. Oh, that's better than key F. I have been wanting to come to planning in Monteverde for years now. Monteverde is the most famous cloud forest in the world. Here, the warm, most wins coming from the Caribbean coast cool off as they gain altitude in the mountains, which creates this pretty much permanent cover of clouds. It looks like something straight out of a Lord of the Rings movie and after months living in the extreme heat of central America in our van, it's can we drove all the way up to? Well, it's probably the top of the mountain here. Now I'm going to do a little stop for some little wildlife watching. Now here at Cafe Colibee, they're really famous because of the big population of sharks. They have a lot of something, but it's not sharks. Oh my god, my goodness, I can see two. I'm really unbelievable. I've never seen hummingbirds this close. So the Colibee Cafe has six different feeders. Just hanging around here in their back garden and you can just come here and watch the hummingbirds right now. They're about a dozen or so, I guess. If you want, you can have a drink here as well, but it's not even mandatory. So nice to be here in the cold after being 35 degrees for a while. Some hot chocolates. A warm cinnamon roll. It's a warm cinnamon roll. Best thing ever. It's a little too big, no? Oh, this is so good. Oh, it feels like we're transferred from summer to like autumn weather and just a blink of four hours. That right there, that's so cool. That's called a Quotty. That's so cool. That hurt. That hurt. It's doing. Anyway, welcome back to the Montet Verde Cloud Forest. Traveling is all about exploring the world, going outside of your comfort zone. And Costa Rica offers plenty of opportunities to do exactly that. Because today. Are you excited Kim? I'm very excited. I'm nervous. You have to control your speed and everything, so not good at those things. So I might die. I might not. It's crazy. Is it good? You're doing me. Good, good. I'm new. Good, I'm going to the center. One, two. All is good, all is super. Yes. Great. The first couple of ziplines were just a warm up for the main event. The Superman zipline. The longest zipline in Latin America. It's a whopping mile long and takes you soaring above the beautiful cloud forest. To do this, they strap you into the zipline in a way that I think is usually reserved for some very particular adult film. Yes. Yes. That's good. Oh my god. Bye bye. Oh my god. This is crazy. That was epic and scary and everything at the same time. Even though not the most exciting thing is still to come. I love it's scared now. I love it's scared not to. This is a free fall of 40 or 50 meters. It's called the mega tarzan swing and a swing from a fine, hopefully cable. Three tarzan, new jane. Tarzan, that's a great. Are you going to scream? I'm going to scream like a little girl. You're not going? No. Okay. You don't want to go over there? No, I want to go over there. I'll think about it. Okay. I'll go over the phone distance. I've never done a free fall before. So this will be the first time actually. Oh my god. Okay. Oh my god. That one down. Yeah. So. So. The whole three flag and dead. Oh my god. Let's do that. Ben Yulis. Is that Manis? And go? And there more? Yeah? Walk up. Here we go. One, two, three, four. Oh my god. Sorry for screaming. Will he scream or will he know? No. I mean, after that jump. I feel like a run through a hole now. That was so scary. Something, something comfort zone. That's amazing. That was pretty far. It sounded like comfort zone. How much did he pay? What's that? For the bar. You earned it. How much did he pay for the store? Some of the doors actually cost $100, $150, which is really, really expensive. I would have never done it for that price. This one is actually $55. And for what you get, I think it's really good price. I'm just going to talk about it. What the heck? I'm so pissed off. I just pulled off the road for a second. There was some parking spots available. One taxi drove by. It's like, oh, this is a taxi stand. And there were four spots I was in one. I was like, okay, I'll leave and Kim was in the back. So we were just about to leave and then another taxi came. And he had a spot. There were still three spots left. But he just, to make a point, he just ran in the back of the van. This guy just did that part. I mean, that's just crazy. I can't see anything on it, fortunately. But can you imagine? I just, just, just to make a point, just, just get out. And I screamed out and like, dude, what the heck, what are you doing? I am fucking crazy in Spanish then. But, and he was like, we are in a soda. We're not in a gano soda. No, no, no. So, guys, the name of a local restaurant, local fruit. It's actually sea traditional breakfast. Of course, the heck, they are called Gaiopinto. Gaiopinto is this rice and beans. She makes like this table, they eat it with everything here. We've got some local cheese here. Fried banana or plantain. Two fried eggs, some toast. Coffee with milk. It's better than I expected. It's just like, they're no rising bean eggs. Not super special. But the flavor is actually really good. The thing is though, this is a tourist now. This is a local eatery. But fries is still quite expensive. Just displayed breakfast costs around $10. And a coffee costs $3.5. Nothing fancy. Basically, these are US diner prices. But we're not in the US. We're in Central America. After breakfast, we went to Monteville National Park for some hiking. But there are a lot of rules here. When you enter, they assign a trail to you to avoid going over capacity on certain spots in the park, I guess. And we have been assigned the best trail in all of the park. The one that takes you over. The famous hanging bridge. Yeah, so excited about it. We're going to be lucky. Wow, this is really something else. This is not the jungle. Like in Manoranto and your this park is a lot for us. It's called Clash Forest because I have an amount. It's about 16,000 meters, but 5,000 feet. It's very Lord of the Ringsy. Massey would like these very cool plants and vines. And everything just looks so magical. I really love this. That's my favorite kind of senior this time. So cool to literally be up in the canopy, in between the trees. Like it's like a 30-foot drop just from here from the start of the bridge. There's no one else here on the bridge right now. Jump, jump. You can feel it wobbling, but you can actually see the trees up close and I like this bridge. Once it was dark, we went on a guided night walk through the Cloud Forest. In Costa Rica, a lot of the locals speak English, which is so rare in Latin America. We really enjoyed having a guide teach us about the Cloud Forest. In Costa Rica, one percent of the forest, it is Cloud Forest. He spotted some really cool critters for us like this bug that is completely covered in moss for camouflage. The name of this friend is mimic moss walking a stick bug. It's a very long name. We saw this tiny frog and a pretty big tarantula. That's an orange-need tarantula. It's hiding in the bright mix to where we were hiking earlier. It's a little creepy. That one in the hole, it is a female. The males probably are walking around the forest looking for something to eat. And we also learned that we probably shouldn't sleep with the windows in the back of the van open anymore. But we've been doing for the last few months to manage the heat. We don't have box screens and just a couple of feet from our van that our guide found this giant scorpion. As the age old saying goes, it's better to be sweaty and to have a scorpion in your bed. So let me share with you the truth that we've discovered about Costa Rica. Is it crowded and touristy? In a lot of places, hell, yes. Is it overpriced? There is no question about it. It is one of the most expensive countries we have visited ever outside of Europe and the US. Probably the most expensive one. Small things like a five dollar water bottle in the park, more expensive food at restaurants after a few days, after a few weeks, those things really start to add up. And I've read that a lot of travelers because of that start feeling like a bit of an ATM here in Costa Rica. A bit taken advantage of I guess because of those super high prices and I do get that. Could you just know that the locals aren't paying these amounts and contrary to a lot of other countries, it's very hard to find that cheap and affordable tier here in Costa Rica. In fact, we haven't managed to find it yet. But despite the prices, despite the crowds, are we going to be leaving after four days? Wow. I still have all my kidneys. I think we're going to be good. We're going to stick around for a couple more weeks.
