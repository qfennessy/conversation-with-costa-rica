Costa Rica is a diverse country with many natural attractions, including beaches, forests, and wildlife.

While the city of San Jose has great museums and cultural attractions, real treasures are found outside the capital in the forests and coastal towns. The Pacific Coast has many beautiful beaches and towns, with Guana Caste being a particularly popular destination. Inland, the forest-covered mountains offer adventures such as volcanoes, waterfalls, zip lining, and wildlife viewing. The south of the country is the best place to go if you want to see a lot of wildlife. The Caribbean Coast has its own unique cultural vibe and calm waters. To help you plan your trip, we have compiled a list of the top tourist attractions in Costa Rica. Number 15. Manuel Antonio National Park. Manuel Antonio National Park is situated on the outskirts of Manuel Antonio Town and is a must-visit destination in Costa Rica for wildlife enthusiasts. Apart from its stunning soft sand beaches, the park offers an opportunity to spot a variety of animals such as howler monkeys, squirrel monkeys, sloths, white-nosed codamundis, and capuchins. Additionally, you can also see beautiful iridescent butterflies and colorful birds while walking the trails. Although you can explore the park on your own, you can have a more comprehensive experience by joining a guided tour. Guides possess telescopes and tripods, which can enhance your wildlife viewing and photography experience. Another advantage of visiting Manuel Antonio National Park is that you can easily find hotels, restaurants, and retail outlets in the nearby town of Manuel Antonio. The primary hub of activity in the town revolves around the picturesque ocean front beach. The beach attracts both sunbaters and surfers, and surf lessons are available for novices. The restaurants and stores situated across the road on the hillside can get a bit noisy in the evenings. For those seeking a luxurious retreat, Manuel Antonio is home to one of Costa Rica's top beach resorts, making it an ideal spot for an extended stay. Number 14. Arena Volcano. The Arena Volcano. National Park, situated in the rugged Cordillera de Tilaran, is a popular spot for observing volcanoes in the country. The highlight of the park is the Arena Volcano, a cone-shaped mountain that often emits huge ash columns from its crater. From AD 1500 until a massive eruption in 1968, Arena was dormant. The eruption killed 82 people and destroyed two villages. Since then, the volcano has been active, and visitors may witness anything from a cloud of ash to glowing red lava depending on the day or week. The park is renowned for its diverse wildlife with about half of Costa Ricans birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals represented within its boundaries. The Arena Observatory Lodge was established in 1987 as a private observatory, and is now the only lodge located within Arena Volcano National Park. Situated on the south side of the volcano on a macadamia nut farm, the lodge offers breathtaking views of both the volcano and arena lake. The area is surrounded by a plethora of hiking trails that lead to beautiful waterfalls and old and recent lava flows. Number 13. Monteverde and the Cloud Forests.

Jocco proves to be a great option for those seeking a change of scenery from San Jose, while still enjoying the amenities of a larger town. The beach is vast, delightful, and has a lively atmosphere. The waves are moderate, making it ideal for surfing and swimming. What makes Jocco stand out from other coastal towns along the Pacific is its modern apartments, shops, excellent dining options, hotels, and other conveniences that attract expats and retirees.

Although it may not have many cultural attractions, the abundant wildlife experiences more than make up for it. Wildlife sightings are frequent, with monkeys, capillons, scarlet macaws, and two cans easily spotted around town. While there are no specific areas for wildlife sightings, visiting parks or taking tours with knowledgeable guides will increase the chances of spotting some of the more elusive species.

By taking a guided walking tour through Manuel Antonio National Park, you can expect to see sloths, various types of monkeys, and several other animals. If you're looking to stay at an eco-lodge, you can stay at the OSA Peninsula, or a mountainside resort around Dominican, Uvita, or Ohochal, and you're likely to encounter some wildlife. However, the northern region is not to be underestimated in terms of wildlife. Even if you're staying at downtown Tamarindo, you can easily spot howler monkeys on the trees and overhead wires along the streets. Keep your eyes open, and you're sure to come across some fascinating critters. Number 8. Tortugaro National Park If you're looking for a unique and unconventional experience, Tortugaro National Park on the Caribbean coast is worth a visit. Accessible only by boat or plane, this region is one of the wettest in the country, and offers a different experience than the rest of Costa Rica. The park is a vital nesting ground for the green sea turtle, so the main activity here is turtle watching. Although there are many beaches, the coastal area is not ideal for swimming due to rough surf and strong currents, and sharks are common. Hundreds, and even thousands of green and leatherback turtles can be seen nesting and laying eggs on the beaches at night. Recent conservation initiatives have boosted the number of turtles nesting in the region. From the hiking trails or boat trips along the canals, visitors can spot monkeys, sloths, and kinkajous.
