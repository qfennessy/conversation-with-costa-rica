Hey guys, just wanted to travel to Dachie coming right at you from Costa Rica. With today, the 7 most common tourist scams here in Costa Rica. To win a point out, though, it's perfectly safe to travel to Costa Rica, to visit Costa Rica. These examples are just petty. And if you watched this video, you can avoid all of it. And I can guarantee you'll have a fabulous time here in Costa Rica. If you're new to this channel, I'm a Dutch expert and I've been living in Costa Rica for the last 16 years. I co-own a travel company so I advise my clients every day on tips, tricks, and how to have the best time in Costa Rica. So without further ado, let's get straight into it with common tourist scam number one. Tourist scam number one is the credit card scam. Now, if you must use a credit card in Costa Rica, be aware. So you can pay almost everywhere with your credit card, but be sure to check your statement often because they would happen. So what could happen is that your credit card is stolen. It actually happened to me once at a gas station. However, again, it was a gas station close to La Portuna. It is the Aranabokina area, very popular. And yeah, I was getting gas and sure enough, the next day, I had all charges that I didn't do. So what I do is I make sure that my credit card is never out of sight. So restaurants, wherever you are using your credit card, just make sure that you asked them to charge right in front of you. They have this credit card machine, which is here called the Datafono. So have them charge right in front of you so nobody can steal your credit card information. Talking about gas stations, though, you also want to make sure that they zero out the colonis and the leaders. So here in Kustrika, there's no, you don't get the gas yourself, you're at the mercy of the attendant. So it has been known that they don't zero out, you know, the leaders or the colonis. So be aware. Then tourist scam number two, which suddenly happens a lot, is the Car rental company scam. So what happens is when you book a Car rental online, they announce that this actually happens to with like the bigger international car rental company that you don't expect it from. So they actually advertise super cheap Car rental prices, which I mean, I understand that in many different areas, this happens, but what you don't know, though, is that they do not inform you of any of the charges that actually get added to the price. And the charges are so high that it will double or even more than double the rental price of your car. And this is obviously something that you want to know, not find out when you arrive and when it's already too late to even decide not to go with that Car rental. So what happens here in Costa Rica is there's a liability insurance that the government men have date you to purchase. It is by law, everybody just must have it. Regardless of what your policy from home offers or what your credit card covers, everybody must purchase this mandatory insurance, but most companies won't tell you until you arrive. Then sadly, they add all kinds of charges like booking fees, pick up servers. You see none of the Car rental companies are actually at the airport. So they need to pick you up and take you to their Car rental company. So then when else happens is there's two additional type of insurance that actually covers the car. They don't explain it clearly to you. And then there's all these like booking fees, like online booking fees, and together with the charge of the shuttle, somehow they lump the two additional insurance is that actually cover the car, the mandatory liability insurance with kinds of fees. And this is your price and often it's more than double what then what you thought it would be. So at this moment in time you arrive in Costa Rica and they took you in their shuttle to their Car rental company. And so this is like almost too late to be like objection, but what happened? Not a nice way to start your vacation, right? It's all very confusing and these companies are taking advantage of that. On top of that you also check really well when you get the car and they go over the damage, when you make sure you check the car well and have them, you know, note all the damages because what happens is you come back, they want to charge you for damages that you actually weren't responsible for. Now to avoid all of this, obviously this is not every company. A lot of them sadly take advantage, but I do know I co-owned a travel company, so we've been using the same company for years now. And we've never had any problems with them. They are actually a family-owned company with experience over 30 years. So if you want to play it safe and go with a trusted company I'm happy to suggest mine. Just go in the description below this video. So at the end of the video, go down to the text box below and there will be a link to the company, the Car rental company that I recommend that won't give you any problems. Number three are the scammers at the landlord's with Nicaragua. So if you were a tourist that would like to travel to Nicaragua or your perpetual tourist that needs to do a visa run and needs to go to Nicaragua, you want to be very careful. So these land border crossings can actually be intimidating. A lot is going on and sadly there's a lot of people that take advantage of the, I don't know where, tourists. So what happens is many, many possible things could happen, friendly non-efficient people at the border offering you to help with paying the Kusuriga exit taxes. And they're overcharging big time. And this is something you could just do yourself. It's not hard and it's not expensive. Or again, friendly non-efficient people offering to help you with the entire immigration process. They take your passport and what I've actually heard is there was one person that said yes to this and they gave him back his passport like with little rips. And he goes through and then at Nicaragua, when he arrived in Nicaragua, the official there said, oh no, I can't let you pass because you have a ripped passport. So you have to pay me $100. So obviously those two were working together. They come up with very creative ways to try to get money from tourists. My friend also had a terrible experience. They were trying to rip her off with what she did is she was traveling with her dogs. One of them is a German shepherd that is trained to attack when things go south. So she, when she learned that she was ripped off too. She got out of the car with her German shepherd and threatened them and she actually got her money back. So just be aware. Don't just accept help from anybody. Just make sure to talk to the officials. Number four is the credit card currency scam. So what happens here, it's actually very simple. You always need to check what currency you're being charged in because if for example you purchase something for $30, they will try to sneak in the 30,000 colonists charge which is a lot more money than $30. So always check and ask what currency you're being charged and I suggest always ask to be charged in US dollars. And number five is the currency cash scam. Very, very common. Luckily, obviously we're not talking about a lot of money but still you know you want to just be careful that you are aware of what the currency exchange is because often you pay cash in US dollars and you get changed back but you won't get the correct change back most of the time. And so obviously you can avoid this by just paying with the local colonists. There's ETFs everywhere. So just get some pocket money out, have some colonists so you can avoid these altogether but if you must spend US dollars to be aware of the currency exchange so that you get the right change back. Tourist scam number six is the broken taxi meter. I do have to say though I think it happens less or we hear about it less but it could also be because people are using Uber. Hmm so I don't know but either way you want to be careful. Also side note Uber is illegal here in Kostraka. A lot of people use it anyways but just so you know it is illegal here if you do take an Uber they will ask you to sit in the back. Now back to the broken taxi meter. If you use an official taxi here which is a red taxi at the airport they will be orange and if you get in and the taxi driver says that his meter is broken then you need to get out because this is obviously a way or most likely it will be a way to take advantage of you so they can do the whole you know overcharging or take the long route anything like that. The taxi meter in Spanish is called Maria. So you are aware because sometimes people take advantage of the fact that they'll you know rambulon in Spanish you don't understand and you just get in and go but you if you can ask them like something along the lines. Again I don't think it happens a lot anymore but just something to be aware of when you take a taxi. Down the last line it is small but oh boy can it be annoying and so on necessary. So what happens is it's called the water bottle scam so what happens is the waiter comes out and pretends to open the bottle you know while he's on your way to the table I say oh I'm opening a brand new bottle and often it is not so be sure that when you order bottled water that the waiter just puts it on the table and you're in the one to open it because sadly they reuse bottles of water and then they just put tap water in it. You can drink the tap water here I've been drinking the tap water here for 16 years a lot of people do it it tasted a little different but you get used to it however if you have a sensitive Tommy and you just hear as a tourist I was to just bottle water anyways I mean my risk it's not that expensive better to see them sorry but technically yes you can drink tap water here that's another thing though if you do want to drink the tap water here then be sure to actually ask for tap water because what they do even if you just ask for a glass of water they often just bring you the bottled water so just be clear as to what it is that you actually want because sometimes they might actually overcharge you big time for the bottled water so that's the water bottle scam again guys it is perfectly safe to come to Costa Rica not everybody wants to rip you off it's just things that happens anywhere in the world that you want to be aware of and you know many tours don't even like you know they didn't hear about this or didn't see this video and they had an amazing time but since you're here you're seeing this video you can be aware and you can ensure that you're going to have an amazing time here in Costa Rica it is absolute paradise here check out my channel I have some videos about hidden gems in Costa Rica the unique spots that you know not every tourist gets to see be sure to subscribe to my channel and click that little bell icon so you receive notifications every time I upload a new video especially when it comes to updates on Costa Rica entry requirements and COVID restrictions all right any questions leave them in the comments section below I'm always happy to help I want to thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video ciao buh-davida
