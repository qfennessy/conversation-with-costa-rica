10 years ago, I would not have believed you if you told me that this is where we would be. I am absolutely more happy here than in the United States. Energetically, it's lighter and again, it's not just the lower cost of living, the improved quality of life. It's the environment, it's the people too. So the Costa Rican people, they smile and they greet you. They call you daughter or queen or beauty or immoranite that, you know, and it's always love. I'm Kim Award, I'm 41 years old. I'm Nicholas Haber and I'm 43 years old. Our family relocated from the United States to Costa Rica. And this is how we live off a $30,000 a year. The biggest change financially coming from the U.S. to Costa Rica is being able to work for ourselves. In the United States, we earned six figures, but we were both doing work that we didn't love. Living here has allowed me to explore my passions so that my methods of earning income don't feel like a job. It just feels like I'm getting to do the things that I love to do, which is to be of service. We were living in Houston, Texas before we decided to move to Costa Rica. Once we decided at the end of 2017, if this is what we were going to do, we tightened up on our budget and we did start saving to make the transition. And then the selling of all of our items gave us a good sum to get here and get started. We did pretty much start over. And I think between the two of us, we had four suitcases and two backpacks. We had not seen the home that we rented. There was a lot of jungle creatures that we encountered. We experienced many insects, many bugs, we've had snake encounters. So it just took a moment to figure out how to work with our environment. Our money absolutely goes further here than in the U.S. We make less money, but we're still living pretty comfortably. 2023 was a rough year, but we're still okay because we're entrepreneurs. Our income fluctuates, but our money definitely goes further. We would never have made it alone. We would probably have to move in with my mom. If we were making what we make now in the United States. It was done here in Benini, Sanlo. In Costa Rica, we probably spend the most money on food. We spare zero expenses when it comes to our food. I was diagnosed with cancer in April of 2016. Undergoing chemotherapy as treatment for the breast cancer was one of the hardest things that I've ever done in my life. I only completed half of the prescribed infusions because I felt like if I did any more that it would kill me. So we quit and we chose a naturopathic route. We had already planned our wedding for July 30th of 2016. And my boss at the time told me, don't let cancer take anything else from you. One of the things that we noticed immediately was that my energy was coming back rapidly. Much faster than it had been while I was in the States. I was eating more, I was moving more, and I just really felt like I was healing while we were here. I think the food and the clean air and water really had an impact on me as we were progressing through the wedding and the honeymoon. Coming back to Houston, we both had this calmness about us. And I actually felt like we were missing out on something since we were coming back to the States. I was really excited with the newfound energy that I had and the mental clarity that I had. And then I was a little saddened because it only lasted for about a week or two. Before I was like really tired again. Another pivotal moment in our decision to leave the United States was when we lost our home to Hurricane Harvey. And we ended up living in a stranger's garage apartment in our neighborhood for a year while we searched for another home. The housing market was insane in Houston during that time because of so many people losing their homes. And after we missed out on the third home, Nick was like, well maybe we should just move. We have nothing holding us here. And I thought he meant to another state or another city, but he was like, no, let's leave the country. In Costa Rica, I feel that people are treated as humans first. That's not always been my experience in the United States. I feel like I'm seen as a black woman first and that doesn't have the positive connotation that it does here. The quality of life in Costa Rica is so much different in the US for a myriad of reasons. My top two would be community and the way that the people will help. It's almost expected on their part. The second aspect for me is healthcare and the affordability of healthcare and the holisticness of the healthcare. We had to go to the emergency room. We have no insurance at the time. They did an EKG, a chest x-ray, an ultrasound and a cancer screening. And when I checked out 90 minutes later, it cost me 160 bucks basically and that's me rounding up. The main health benefits I've noticed since moving to Costa Rica immediately was the weight loss. Also, I have been told that I would not be able to have any more children without the help of fertility specialists because of the chemo and the cancer. And we were pregnant 13 to 14 months after moving here and that was a huge surprise. I am also now cancer free and I really do believe that is because of being here. The most challenging aspect for me transitioning to Costa Rica was just missing people like family and friends. When my sister passed, I was not able to go home. It wasn't just being in Costa Rica, it was COVID as well. So that was really, really difficult to not be able to go be with my family when we suffered such a big loss. We see Costa Rica as our home base for the rest of our lives. But I know for a fact that we still have this passion to travel the world. I want to go since a few months in Colombia, we want to go to Ghana, Tanzania, we want to go to Europe. So I think Costa Rica will always be home based. This is where we will always return to. But I can't say that we won't spend a year somewhere else in the world at some point in the future. Our financial goal is to build a nice thinker for our family. And to rebuild our savings. I am definitely happier living in Costa Rica than I used to be in the United States. I've gained my family back. I've gained the opportunity to spend time with them and create more freedom in myself. But also freedom within our family to explore our dreams and our passions. Thank you.
