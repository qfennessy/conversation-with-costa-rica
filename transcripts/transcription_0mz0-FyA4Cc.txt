Hey guys, Ian and Anna here from the other side vlog. A lot of you already knew that we were just in Costa Rica for about 25 days. And next week we're coming out with our top 10 Costa Rica video. Before we did that, and shared all the amazing things this country has to offer, we wanted to talk to you about some warnings. Most countries we go to always have some sort of scam going on, whether that's big or small. But if you don't catch it really early on, it will add up. It adds up. So we're here to warn you, get you ready, and hopefully tell the locals not to do this. The more they get taught that, the less they'll do it. The lot of the scams you run into across countries are very similar. Where it'll be like a taxi driver just charging you more. You know, we're used to that stuff. This one was very interesting though, and we didn't realize it until about 10 days into our trip. So who knows how many times this actually happened to us. But basically in Costa Rica, and I've also heard, because I mentioned this on Instagram, that this is common in a lot of Central American countries. So I'm not like singling out Costa Rica, but warning you, tourists. Basically, when you go to order and you get your bill, double check your bill at the end. That's really all there is to it, because they're going to add on a lot of items. Ian's birthday, he had like two drinks and I had one, and they charged us for eight. So they more than doubled it, and that was a lot for drinks on his birthday. On my birthday, who does that? I think they thought we were like getting tipsy and we wouldn't notice, but Ian went in. And it's so funny, because every single time this has happened, which by the way, once we realized it was a thing, it happened to us every single day at least once at some dinner or lunch place. And the craziest part was this wasn't just in one town. We were all over the west coast of Costa Rica, and it happened everywhere. Once we were even with a local, and they tried to pull out on us, and I was like, are you... Is anyone seeing this? Like, is this not... Yeah, it happened to us in Uvita, Santa Teresa, Tambor, La Fortuna, La Fortuna, all over Costa Rica. And so it's so funny, because every single time we went to confront the people, hey, you charged me an extra, they knew right away. Like, it wasn't like, oh, I'm so, oh, I must check. They just, they knew that we caught them. I'm ranting, I'm just the ****. Because I appreciate honesty, like, if you're a server, and you treat me well, I'm gonna treat you well. I'll give you a good tip. But if you try to scam me, why would I like you after that? I don't know. You're not getting the tip. Just so you guys know, we are dead tired, because we just did a two-day trip to get to Cairo, Egypt. You guys guessed it in our community tab earlier on. Right behind us is an amazing view of the pyramids, the great pyramids at Giza. The second one isn't really a scam, but a lot of people like to call it a scam. It's the car rental dilemma in Costa Rica. And this is really filtered towards high season, which most things are because high season is when prices are going to be completely jacked up. Long story short is in Costa Rica. Car rentals are very expensive. So if you see anything online, and it's like, oh, this deal, come in, get it, and you book your car. It's just false advertising, because when you get to Costa Rica, basically they tag on taxes and fees that are mandatory. Not only that, it's a mandatory insurance policy from the government that you have to implement on all car sales, rental car sales throughout the country. So every car rental car company has to do it, and it's a lot of money. It's like $300 to $400 on top of your price. Which again, it's one of those things. Just tell me how much I'm going to pay. And I'll pay for it, but don't catch me off guard because it just throws off your whole trip. This did not happen to us because we booked through Enterprise, and I say this in our top 10 video, but I'll say one more time, and I'm done sharing this, so they probably shouldn't be. But basically I have a friend that gave me one of her corporate codes for a discount on Enterprise. All those companies have corporate codes, so that is a huge hack. We got half off our price. We spent $1,400 for 16 days. It's a lot of money. Just a little less than our rent. One last thing about Costa Rica is the only national park that made us feel overwhelmed or uncomfortable. It was Maniwon, Tonyo National Park, and K-Post. Right at the entrance, it's not even at the entrance. It's a mile away from the entrance. They have these fake guards, they're locals with fake vass, fake badges, and they're trying to make you pull into their own parking lots. I got a video of them, and they got really mad and mad and mad and mad. Oh, what you have in your phone? I have it. I'll just pull over later. We got super mean to us. They ran in front of our car, stopped us, they tried to delete the video. Be sure not to stop. The biggest tip I have is to tell them that you are picking up a friend at the front gate of Maniwon, Tonyo. Right when we told them that, they're like, oh, go ahead, no worries. We just left the national park. So you already went to the park? Yeah, we already went. You literally have to walk so far. There's no shuttle. So we were seeing these poor people, I can't even, it's really far. Like at least a mile. Yeah, they, they, they the walk like 30 minutes before they even got the entrance of Maniwon, Tonyo. So they were sweating before they even got to the park. It's so hot. Right. Like it's not easy to walk in Costa Rica. I think it needs to be spread far and wide. So share this with anyone hiding in Costa Rica, because it's going to make you feel uncomfortable. But the closer you get to the entrance, there are actual parking people. You can't go into the park in park. So basically you want to go as close as you can. They really need to fix that so Torres can enjoy their time there, because you are paying to go into the park. I just think when there are moments like this no matter where you're traveling, it ruins your vibe. Yeah. And you have a bad mindset. So like we got into Maniwon, Tonyo, which is the number one visited national park in Costa Rica. We saw a sloth, many birds. I mean, you see so many cool things there. Yeah. But your mindset was just clouded because everyone's yelling at you. It leaves a bad taste to hear about, but let us tell you after spending three weeks, a little bit more than three weeks in Costa Rica. The locals there are some of the nicest we've ever met on the road. So you should not be nervous. Just look at your bills. Do not be scared of scam artists. Costa Rica is a little bit more expensive than we expected. But anyone from the US, you should come down here. There's flights that are cheap from every big airport. That's all. And I hope you don't think we're being like negative because I know we don't always go into this stuff. But we just felt like it's important. I shared it on my Instagram story and people loved it. So I was like, well, we got to share it with our YouTube people. Yeah. You guys are the real homies. So make sure to follow along on our journey. We're right now in Egypt and heading to Jordan. You can hear the call of prayers going on behind us. So it's a little loud. We have a playlist with all our Costa Rica videos. We hope you enjoy them. Follow us on Instagram. Subscribe.
