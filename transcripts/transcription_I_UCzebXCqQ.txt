Hi guys, welcome to our video Tamarindo explained and in this video we're going to be explaining Tamarindo just as the title says we're going to be breaking this video down into a couple main sections first we're going to be explaining the geographical layout of Tamarindo. The next we're going to be going over some activities, local cuisine, and different beaches that you might want to surf at because I'm a big surfer and if you are to you like this video and   we've been living here for the past five months so we have some good information to share with you. We're going to break Tamarindo kind into three different zones the north, the south, and the inland a little bit. Away from the beach because you know how it's grown it used to be just a little beachfront town and now they're progressing and working inland so there's so much to see once you step off the beach. And then there's another area called Plylon Gusa which we'll mention in this part as well. So most likely the way that you're going to be coming in to town is this main intersection where Vial Real is and you can head down the road down to Tamarindo. So the first area that you're going to see is the Automarcado which is this really nice big fancy grocery supermarket area. So if you want to step outside of the local field that's where you're going to get more of the high-end luxury. Yeah it's kind of like the Bougie American section. I wasn't going to say that but that's what it is. Now the next area kind of going down from there is going to be around which is rock. There's a lot of surf companies right around there that rent boards do lessons because that's where a lot of the main surfing is at right here in the central part of Tamarindo Beach. I like the OG neighborhood of one Tamarindo started. Yes. Surfing into Tamarindo you're going to be near which is rock. Just across the street from which is rock and that whole area off the beach is a lot of hotels and Airbnb's but the thing to be aware of you'll be looking they're all say five minute walk from the beach which is true but the elevation as soon as you get off the beach goes straight up. Now not all of them are up on the hill but a lot of them are up on a big hill. But to hike or get a cab. Yeah that's a cool place there's a lot of around there but it's not really central. It's everything. If you're into diving there's an amazing dive shop here called Tamarindo diving and they took me out on an amazing dive at the Catalina Islands. Definitely worth checking out. Tamarindo diving offers a great experience. They take you out on the boat and it's not just diving it's the whole boat ride out to the Catalina Islands. That's just incredibly beautiful dolphins turtles meeting and the dive was full of wildlife as well. Definitely worth doing if you're into diving or even snarkly. Next is going to be the south part of town so you come in through the north way and you're still driving on the beach front road and you just keep going straight. Eventually you will end up in a roundabout. So essentially it's a dead end there but during that roundabout there are most of the bars are the dance clubs the beachfront restaurants. Tons of cute little boutique for shopping if you're a shopper just start it one in and walk all the way down and around and come back through. So instead of going straight towards the downtown area you'll see this left hand turn. It almost seems like you're supposed to go left and so if you head left now you're on like another main strip where there's a lot of other food courts right along this road there's a couple bars but you'll see another left hand turn. If you go left it's going to bring you to the skate park and now the cool thing about the skate park is actually sitting right behind us is it's a part for kids to play at but it's also where the Saturday morning market is at. If you guys if you're watching our channel for a bit you know that I love a good market and this farmer's market has everything that you would expect right for fruit vegetables handmade crafts, juices, music, kids playing, it's definitely worth a walk if you're here on a Saturday morning. Yeah it's a lively market lots happening so that's really cool. It says 8 to 1 but it's period of 8 so maybe don't stroll into like 8 or 10 or 9 if you want to see all of the vendors already. You go back out to the main street and you keep going up you'll see an intersection that you can go two ways and go straight or right right there on the corner is Villa. Very obvious it's gorgeous it's brand new it's really clean looking yeah there's a lot of there's a great sushi restaurant in there a lot of food options our favorite ice cream places there called pan yosuga is definitely worth checking out they have these wonderfully delicious sugar coated bread cones and the owners are so kind yes and just love to give you sugar yeah yeah so at this intersection now if you were to go straight you're going to be going to the inland a little bit area of town and this kind of covers more than just this little spot but you have the Vindee as soon as you go right past the real nice complex we were just talking about and the Vindee is another small nicer grocery store but the main thing I want to talk about is the bank that's attached to it as well that has the best ATM in town if you need to pull out some money. Eagle blood dollars or colonies there zone it's easy to use and speaking about money here in Tamarindo they will accept US dollar and Costa Rican colonists but if you leave Tamarindo most places don't want to take US money so if you're going to pull money out I would pull out colonists and unlike 15 years ago credit cards and debit cards are when they accepted the conversion rate to the US dollar to colonists is one US dollar to about 550 Costa Rican colonists so everything you're buying here is like in the thousands so a little rule of thumb that makes it easier is that if something is two dollars US it's going to be 1,000 colonists that was a bug we have this terrible bug which is hanging out it's just loving my melee objects oh I'm not so yeah so now working your way past the Vindee you're going to be heading towards the Thursday night market which is really popping yes glide music the sends already down there's strung up lights and a lot of life young old local tourists everybody is there just like the Saturday morning market there are still vendors selling jewelry and food it's just geared more towards nighttime phase and we try to go every Thursday because there's always new music you see it from your face is yeah it's a lot of fun it's definitely worth checking out but it's right here so now heading back to that three-way intersection if you take a ride at that intersection where you start heading south we're going to be going back into the south area of town and there is a bike shop there called handlebar and that is definitely unique place it's a bar it's a small restaurant but primarily they rent bikes and they've got really good deals especially if you're staying for more than a day or two and bikes are great around here you really get anywhere you need to be within this area during the busy season it's hard to drive a car around top because it's so busy there's like no parking so really bikes are a fantastic option and you can ride them on the beach at low tide. As handlebar on the right on the corner is a food truck neighborhood I mean they have I don't know it doesn't or two food trucks is lined up side by side by side it's a party I feel like every night if you walk by so if you were to keep walking down that dirt road forwards to beach from the food truck area that's where all of the boats pretty much pick everybody else up for catarons, fishing, whatever else you might be doing. Okay so now we're at Nordico coffee filming this section right here and see the logo in the background and this is one of our favorite cafes in town and if you're super super into coffee they have the best coffee in town because they roasted here themselves. Olaf is amazing comes for them. So we got to experience play tide cataron. Play tide is a cataron charter company that picks you up on the beach like Matt was talking about they provide everything for the entire day and take you out to sea there's lunch there's drinks paddle boarding, circling it's pretty much a full experience offshore that you can't get anywhere else or any other time. Yeah and if you come to Timerundo you really have to get outside of the bay here because inside the bay the water's pretty but the coastline as soon as you get outside the bay is absolutely stunning it's definitely worth doing especially a sunset tour. And the thing out on time if year it is there's turtles and whales, all the things yeah you can't see just hanging out on the beach. So now we're going to keep heading south down this main road to Langosta. Now on the way to Langosta or really the start of it is one of our favorite beaches in town called Suicos. It's a great place to hang out a good place for beginners to surf. So that beach is unofficially called Suicos and everybody knows where you're going if you say that. Yep. And now if you continue past there there's a lot of different restaurants it's kind of a quieter part not as busy beach down in Langosta it's totally different than the beach here at Timerundo. It's all rocks it's beautiful it's maybe not the best place to go play in the water with your kids but it's an amazing place to just sit and relax and to see an incredibly beautiful view. Okay. Talk about the surfing that's right here in the general area. Right now we are at Suicos. What Suicos is towards Langosta but it's really the best place as a beginner to learn. It's my favorite. Yeah this is where Eric comes because the waves are a bit more relaxed. They don't have as much power which makes it a little bit of a safer, easier ride. Now your next best go to if you're learning is the main Timerundo beach. The waves there do have a little bit more power and the reason why you would think well it's just down the beach a little bit what's the difference. While here in San Marendo we're in a big bay pretty much and a lot of the beaches are protected from the waves. Suicos is like the most protected. Still has little waves though. San Marendo is a little bit more exposed and then you keep going and you get to play a Grande. It's a massive beach but all the waves just come right into the bay and crash a lot bigger a lot more powerful there but the other closer best bet is Langosta at the river mouth and that is a really fun place to surf. There's a lot of bigger waves there. It's stronger. There are rocks out there so it's really advanced surfers only especially at that beach break. Speaking of Langosta I'm a beginner and magician the author on a small day and I came home with stitches. So you advance surfers and have added not so much for the little guys. Okay guys now it's time to talk about restaurants. Foodie time. Yes and there is an unbelievable amount of restaurants here in San Marendo. Guys unbelievable amount. You'll get more than just rice beans, plantains and chicken. There's so much here but I do want traditional cooking. Matt's got the soda for you. And what we didn't know when we first got here was what soda meant and we're driving down the highway looking at all the signs just seeing everywhere soda soda and we thought that Costa Rica just loves soda pop but there's local restaurants. There's two sodas that I really want to talk about that I recommend going to. The first one I'm looking out my phone for the name is soda buffet El Estro and that is that I always say it wrong but Eric owns that it's an amazing soda to go eat at. It's in the north part of town I'll show you on the map right here where it is and the food there is great healthy options and it's a great meal for after serving. The next one is I don't even know the name or her name it's I just call her the red van lady and she's right here on the main street I'll show that on the map as well and if you just walk down it's 3,000 clones for just like it's a go box of amazing I don't you don't even know what it is I just tell her to give me her favorite and I'm never disappointed. Well it switches every day she makes it at home brings it in her van and you get what you get. Yeah it's just a bunch of pots in the back of the van it's amazing it's actually honestly some of the best tasting food that I've had here in San Miranda. If you were coming with a variety of ages let's say grandma grandpa and the kids are coming we have the place for you and it's called the surf shack. It's like an open air restaurant tons of seating and in the very very back as a full playground it's just a really cool place you can actually go and sit and it's right off the beach. So they're located in the downtown area and the type of food that they have is kind of more like burgers messy fries and delicious wings the food there is really good. It's just a really nice place at the end of the day if you want to go hang out. We found out about this restaurant called Dragonfly and how I heard about it was their maize sushi but literally no one we got there a sushi the sushi is just like a small part of their menu. So Dragonfly is definitely on the higher-end side of the restaurants here in town. It's a bit more fine dining although you don't necessarily have to dress crazy fancy to go there. It's just the quality of the food is fine dining quality. Definitely go there to check it out. It's a perfect date night or they're kind of a quieter chill live music vibes. Yeah it's a wonderful place to go and with highly recommend Dragonfly. So Erica has something that's totally in her mouth. Surfing goes in mine. I know I'm not the only one out there so if you're one of those weirdos that pack your tennis shoes on vacation you're welcome because in Tamarono there is like indoor rock climbing at least three gyms with we awaits inside yoga silks all of the things if you have something you love more than likely it is here so bring your shoes and your energy you will get a workout.
