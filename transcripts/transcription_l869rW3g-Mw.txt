Welcome to Uvita, an adventure lovers dream and a true slice of Costa Rican paradise or Jamie and Skylar and we spent half of our eight days in Costa Rica exploring in and around this beautiful beach and mountain town and we can't wait to show you what makes Uvita Costa Rica so unforgettable. Today we are in Uvita Costa Rica and what better way to start day than at the famous whale tail. We've got a whole lot of this Costa Rican treasure to show you but first Skylar is going to recap how we got here. We flew from Orlando to San Jose where we rented a car and drove through the mountains at night to our first of five different Airbnbs on this trip. Day two consists of a lot of waterfalls which turned out to be my preferred method of showering in Costa Rica. Most of the waterfalls were pretty awesome but not so much this one. We found another waterfall. We also got lost somewhere near volcano and got to cross the river in this day. And we go faster please. After another crazy mountain drive full of fog, great views and one random cow. Look at this cow! I mean how do you get up here? We arrived at our second Airbnbs and hit the hay to rest up for an epic mountain hike. We had beautiful weather for our day three hike but we're a little worried when we still hadn't seen a single other hiker after several miles on the trail but we made it back alive and saw some amazing views so we're calling it a success. Since our hike took much longer than expected we'd be driving in the dark to Uvida which meant we wouldn't be driving through the hill of death because we didn't actually want to die. After a slow but scenic drive along a much safer route we arrived at our Uvida Airbnbs for some much needed sleep and that brings us to the day which we started with a giant ice coffee at Cape Juana's Cafe. We then began the drive to what we thought was the entrance to Marina Bayena National Park but as Google Maps often does in Costa Rica it took us to the middle of nowhere. We eventually located the actual park entrance where we found nearby parking for around four American dollars. We're here at the park and here are just a ton of monkeys in these trees. After hanging out with the monkeys and paying another six dollar her adult fee we could finally enter the park. If you want to see much more of our first three days of Costa Rican adventure be sure to check out this video after the one you're watching but for now it's time to explore the Whale Stale. Of all the spots we visited on our travels the Whale Stale is surely one of the most unique and if you're wondering how it got its name this should answer it for you. But in addition to its coastline forming a distinct shape of a Whale Stale the name is quite fitting for another reason as well. This spot is also known for its amazing whale watching as hundreds of humpback whales migrate through the area each and every year. While we weren't lucky enough to spot a humpback we didn't regret visiting the Whale's tale a bit as the sheer beauty of this tropical paradise is reason to visit alone. As we made our way out to the tail of the whale we noticed that the majority of beachgoers were headed back towards the shore meaning we'd have this magnificent stretch of beach nearly all to ourselves. So we have made it out to the tail to the left we've got one side of the tail to the right we've got the other side of the tail and looking back at land this is the Whale's body now very soon this will all be underwater. And as the tide continues to come in the water from each side will get stronger and eventually they'll be big waves that run into each other and make a vertical splash. I'm not sure if we'll be around long enough to see that this time but we definitely witnessed that the last time we were in Costa Rica. When we were here in Costa Rica last time we missed low tide by several hours in this area where people were walking it was completely covered in water maybe about two three foot deep and we might put just a little bit of footage that we took but this was like seven or eight years ago so we were not really filming for a channel and the footage is not that good but I still think it's really cool to see those waves like crashing against each other because you can't really see that other places. No this is definitely pretty. Yeah. Now when we walked out to the Whale's tail like 15 minutes ago we had to go through like maybe an inch of water and it's gonna get deeper fast. We're getting ready for the walk back to the water we'll let you know how deep it gets. We've got a drive-back still with anything that we don't want wet. It's very good. I'm not a strong. They pull you one way and then they pull you down the way but the ride will be the like one and two foot deep. We're only like three hours maybe past low tide right now and already the whale's entire body is submerged. All you can see is the tail and a little bit of the head over there. Some of these waves have definitely been way steep. As the tides continue to rise at the Whale's tail it was time for us to head back to shore and after taking in some more of these breathtaking beach views we were ready to move on to our next adventure of the day but not before one more quick stop to watch the monkeys. I'm not sure if you can tell but that monkey has a baby on its back. Wow. They're all over in the sand booth. So after starting the day with coffee and the Whale's tail we're gonna go grab some lunch and then show you another waterfall. Skyler searched for a restaurant with a view here in Ovidah. I think he found a good one. So far it's looking promising. Yeah so we didn't have to drive up a pretty steep narrow road and we briefly met a tour bus but we were able to go into a driveway and get past just fine. Look at that view. Yeah that'll work. Let's get that table right there. Alright. Wow I say you found a pretty good spot. That's where we were an hour ago. A tiny bit of a tail is still above water. Yeah if you look you can see kind of the line of the waves to the area that we walked out to for a quick Google for a place with the views. This wasn't even on our radar 15 minutes ago. No. Oh my gosh. So they had a bunch of different fresh juices including fresh passion fruit juice so I got a fresh passion fruit blended with ice and the I don't know. And with this view. For my drink I went with a fresh guana bona juice which was a bit tart a bit sweet and absolutely delicious. On not every restaurant in Costa Rica has the variety of fresh tropical juices that this spot did. It seemed that most restaurants had at least a few which is one of our favorite things about Costa Rica. Another thing that is widely available throughout Costa Rica is fresh ceviche and while Skyler made this his lunch order I went with the garlic fish filet. Both dishes were great and while the prices were a little steep for Costa Rica standards we were more than happy to pay them to get these views. So that lunch thought was totally worth it. Even if you're not looking for a meal if you just want to come up for a drink or like a fresh juice the views are worth the drive up here. After a morning on the Whale's Tale and a lunch with a view it was time to find another waterfall. Thankfully this spot was just a couple of miles outside of Uvida and we knew exactly how to get there. After a short but pretty slow drive on some more steep and very bumpy roads we arrived at the entrance to Caterrata Uvida where you'll find access to the waterfalls for around four dollars per person and also a restaurant. So we're heading down to the waterfall now we can already hear it so it can't be too far away and we were just told by the audience that we should be watching out for snakes and apparently the arvenomess was feeding eyes on the ground. After a couple minutes on the trail and just a few steps we had reached the river where we found markers on the rocks pointing us along the route to the waterfall and while I can't say that getting to the waterfall was easy it was quite a bit of fun and definitely worth the effort. When we visited years ago these cables were not here at all and we were just kind of exploring around on the boulders. It is kind of nice to have these. I'm going to start recording that like an actually good approach. Once across the river we passed by a couple of smaller waterfalls and went back across the river again before reaching the falls that we had come to see. While I was beyond content is relaxing and taking in the views of the falls after spotting some guys jumping off the falls Skyler had to join them but since there was a ladder and Skyler promised to only go to the lowest jumping spot I wasn't too worried. Since the first waterfall jump resulted in no injuries Skyler decided to jump from a little bit higher which made me a lot more nervous. Well thanks to some guys from Vancouver Canada Skyler was able to find the right spot to jump from. I was pretty nervous about it. One of them was super nice and hung back with me to make sure that he got his footing right. But it sounds like they do some slip jumping so they're going to work very excited. On the way back to the parking lot we came across this green and black poison dart frog. As their name would suggest these unique looking frogs are indeed poisonous and while safe to observe from a distance should definitely not be touched. Further down the trail we came across a great pool for swimming and a fun jumping spot for those who aren't quite ready to take on the big falls. So admission to the waterfall also comes with admission to this butterfly garden. We've seen a ton of butterflies just out on our hikes so can't imagine how many we'll see in here. Unfortunately we didn't find a whole lot of butterflies in this garden but found it to still be worth checking out just to see the beautiful tropical flowers. So we've got a one and a half kilometer ride of this mountain to get to our sunset spot. I think we're going to get there maybe 10 minutes before and we can't see it a little off to the left. So it hasn't said yet but it might go down pretty quickly. I got it on rock and dirt mode. It is nice to have a four wheel drive when going up to places like this. Every vehicle we've met has to have fun for a four wheel drive. Yeah. They have no idea how to get into this road because I have a feeling that I'm probably going to be the one driving down it. Oh. We can see it. I think we're going to have about 10 minutes before the sun actually sets.

While we did arrive at this mountain top bar and grill just in time for sunset it had become quite overcast and there wasn't too much of one to see. But nevertheless the views were still amazing and this cocktail known as the Bohemian was one of Skyler's favorite drinks of the entire trip. In addition to some fantastic cocktails Jolly Roger is also known for having great burgers and wings but we had another spot in line for dinner. And that was the Whale-Tale brewery which is not only a video's only brewery but also has some great food and an even better atmosphere. After much consideration Skyler went with the wild Micos Scottishale which was his favorite beer of all the beers he's tried in Costa Rica. One of my favorite things about this brewery was that they had a smoothie menu from which I chose the Loparoa which included strawberry, peppermint and gender and tasted amazing in this beautifully landscape patio area. But perhaps the coolest feature of this brewery is that this beautiful path right off the patio leads to the Whale-Tale Hotel. You can stay at the Whale-Tale Hotel in the block of Costa's Path of the brewery. After a few minutes of exploring around the property our food order was ready which consisted of this order of shredded chicken nachos. And while it was far from the largest order of nachos we've ever seen they tasted amazing especially with the little barbecue sauce on the side. We both enjoyed this brewery so much that we agreed we'd look into staying at the Whale-Tale Hotel for our next trip to Evita. But after finishing our food and drinks and hanging out with the brewery cat it was time to head back to our Airbnb to rest up for a day of beaches, caves and waterfalls on our 5th day in Costa Rica.
