  This is the Island Opera TV and today we're coming to you from Costa Rico. We're going to show you the best places to visit. Let's do it. That's right Island Hoppers. We're going to explore 12 different areas of Costa Rica. Pretty much everything that you could possibly want to see while you're here. Give a lot of facts so you're definitely going to want to stick around and watch this one. We're going to go to the Caribbean and the Pacific side. First up here we are at Papagayo Peninsula. This here is in Guana Caste which is one of the most prestigious provinces for tourists to visit while in Costa Rica. Now it is in the northwestern part towards Nicaragua and you will notice that many different high-end resorts are here like Planet Hollywood. They also have a high-end and the four seasons. Payo, this here is a look at the Planet Hollywood all-inclusive resort. If you plan to spend a significant amount of time at a resort then all-inclusive is a great bargain. So we got an immersive experience. You got to put on these headphones to go watch the show. So the way the Silent Disco here works is you get to have all the fun with the loud music but you don't keep all the other guests awake. So if you're one of those people who plans to go to sleep early, this kind of Silent Disco works really good because you don't have to hear flaring music while you're trying to sleep. But everyone else who wants the party in dance can still do so. There's also rock and parties at the beach in the daytime so it's a really fun place here at the Planet Hollywood but consider the high-end or four season. Now here we are in a town called Pacifico. This beach is called Cocos Paya or Paya del Cocos. Being that it sits on the Pacific Ocean side of Costa Rica you can expect the beaches to be white sand but not like you will get on the carabin inside. Now if you wanted to arrive here in Papagayo you would land at Liberia Airport to get down to Papagayo is about 35 to 40 minutes by car so keep that mind when choosing to visit here. Now there are several beach areas south of Papagayo like Cocos Beach and several others. This is all going to be many different beaches all the way down to Las Catalinas and then you come into the southern part of Guadacoste. Now at Las Catalinas there are several resorts here at Las Catalinas that may be interesting to you but if you check out Paya Donnita this area right here you can walk around. Paya Portrero it's more of a relaxing vibe than you're going to get in other places across Costa Rica so consider this whole area of Guadacoste it's really a popular place with foreigners. Another area that I would suggest checking out is Paya Flamingo so you've got lots of options here in this area. Now we're actually headed south a bit we're going to Tamarindo the nickname for Tamarindo is Tamaringo, no pun intended hopefully no one gets offended by that it's just a fun nickname that the locals have given to Tamarindo because there are so many foreigners here. So now here we are at Paya Lungasta this is actually on the other side of Tamarindo Beach and let me flip the camera around here you can see lots of beach action over here a lot less people they've got some condos over here and some resort style living oxidantals over here see they got professional massage but trees really a beautiful place here. So I just showed you Paya Lungasta which is a lot more relaxed now we're just going to walk around Tamarindo here this is where most of the people hang out do beach activities go out on sunset cruises go out and do some tours around the surrounding beaches just a nice area to hang out so this is a look at the beach on Tamarindo. If you do surfing or if you ever wanted to learn how to do surfing this is probably where you want to go there's a couple places in Costa Rica that are special for surfing the other one being Haco but Tamarindo is a great place to learn. Alright so from Tamarindo we're actually going to go even further this time we're headed to the Nacoya Peninsula check out some beaches and some of the popular towns. Now I'm in Paya Ostonia. Big old beach here here we are now at the beaches of Nassara. They say Nassara is like how Tamarindo was 10 to 15 years ago so it's a bit harder to get to because it's a bit further south about an hour away but people are starting to migrate down here so if you're looking for something a little bit more tame than Tamarindo you might just like the area around Nassara. They've got lots of beaches here in this whole region. We're even going to go further south to Samara so this whole area right here is some of the most up and coming parts of Costa Rica. Now here we are in Samara is a beautiful town in the northern part of Nacoya. Now if you ask me which one I prefer more Nassara or Samara I'm going to go with Samara just because there's so much more in the area that I really like also if you go a little bit further south you will see wild parrots just flying around and I really enjoy being in a place like that. I stayed at a Marriott down there. That Kuntai Sleeta and that was just awesome so that was about 30 minutes south of Samara. Lots of dirt rogues out of here so it's not as developed and again if you wanted to actually get here the best airport to arrive into is going to be Liberia. If you came in from San Jose it would probably take you three or four hours. They do have smaller commuter regional airports but I would say still Liberia is probably your best bet. I actually rented a car at the Liberia Airport and then I was just driving all across Nacoya and around the Punteranus area. Now here we are south of Samara this is Playa Esleeta. So like I said I stayed at the Marriott here this was the Punta Esleeta Marriott if you wanted to also look for this one. Really remote out here in the jungles. Howler monkeys were here, wild parrots. Really a great experience so check this one out. Now the next morning what I ended up doing was taking the dirt road all the way down to Santa Teresa and I'm going to show you what I came across while doing this like Playa Coyote and so many others. Now the interesting thing about this is there is some river crossings that can be a bit challenging thankfully there wasn't anything too strong but keep that in mind if and when it's rainy season but you can see they were having a Caballero festival at Playa Coyote. Well after quite a crazy ride about two and a half and three hours from Samara or Esleeta has arrived in Playa Hermosa just outside of Santa Teresa. Good morning from Santa Teresa Beach the surfing Caballero Costa Rica. Yeah, Santa Teresa is another one of those places to do surfing. There's also some places on the Caribbean side. Well after a long drive I have arrived. Nice hotel here. I'm trying to get the AC to work correctly though. I had to wash my feet so I've already kind of been here for about half an hour. I was like you know what I better make a video before I really settle in. This little patio here. Cool. All right Santa Teresa Beach. Sunsets, surfing, waterfalls, and some really unique nighttime vibes you'll find here in the jungles around Santa Teresa. Now remember the Nucoya Peninsula is one of the blue zones in the world. There's only five in Nucoya is one of them. That's a place where people live to be 100 years or older. More often than other places around the world. So this is my breakfast. This is a traditional American breakfast I would say. Santa Teresa is known for its Bohemian vibe so you will see a lot of people from Europe hanging out here. It's become a popular place with people from over there. They really seem to migrate and gravitate towards Santa Teresa. Oh half of the town here in Santa Teresa is uh to Roe-Gstill. So I'm going to head over towards the other part of the Nucoya and Southmark which is going to be like Montezuma. But I wanted to stop here at the beach in the morning and just show you what San Teresa looks like in the mornings. Another way to get around the dirt roads here in Santa Teresa and the southern part of Nucoya is one of these all-terrain vehicles side by side. So I would suggest considering getting one of these because you know the dirt roads it handles better. It's a little bit more equipped for this region. But once you go down from Santa Teresa to Montezuma takes around 35 minutes maybe an hour just depending on traffic. But yeah I would definitely recommend going down here to Montezuma. From here you can also access a lot of places in the Gulfo right there including Esla Tortuga. There also have a national park down here called Cabo Blanca which will be showing you right now. You also have this hanging canopy bridge where they have several different waterfalls. Like I said this Montezuma area really is impressive. And if you ask me which one I prefer Santa Teresa or Montezuma I'm going to say Santa Teresa has more infrastructure, probably better hotels. But Montezuma just the vibes down here are really amazing. So definitely worth checking out. It's really close to Santa Teresa if you just want to do a day trip down here. By the way if you guys are enjoying this video consider subscribing to the channel liking the video as we continue to show you Costa Rica. This is a really remote part of Costa Rica. I mean don't get me wrong there's so many different remote parts of Costa Rica where you can really find peace and relaxation along the coastline. But Montezuma is one of those places where you can really chill out and relax and find eco resorts just totally out there off grid immersed with the locals still at a hotel. Also down here in Montezuma they do have turtle releases where they hatch the turtles and then they release the little babies out into the ocean. That's fun. That happens around sunset. You'll have to check if they're going to be doing that when you're there. I don't know the exact schedule I think it varies. Also they have a bit more nightlife that I like down here in Montezuma. It might not be for everyone but for me it was better. Also they had a lot of lobster and seafood fresh catches here that I didn't see in Santa Teresa. Yeah so what we're going to do now is we're actually going to show you around the Cabo Blanco National Park area. Here in Cabo Blanco they have a hike. Make sure you get the hours right because they close a bit early. They have different openings and stuff so make sure you pay attention to that before coming all the way down here. But when you're in Cabo Blanco be ready to see lots of different wildlife you never know what you'll see out here. Lots of howler monkeys though. Now like I said there is a really cool island that's nearby Montezuma and you can take a high boat tour from here which takes about 45 minutes to get to Tortuga Island and I would say this is probably the most beautiful island in Costa Rica right here at the tip of the Nikoia Peninsula. So definitely add this to your list of things to do when in Santa Teresa or Montezuma. Well one thing I will say about this part of the Nikoia on the south there's a very nice paved road. I haven't seen any potholes on this. The paved road in between Santa Teresa and Montezuma had a lot of potholes but once you get past Montezuma it seems like the road has a lot smoother ride. This here is called Bellina Bay or Bahuia Bellina. Bellina in Spanish is well. It's a big beach. The faces towards Haco you can see Haco out over there. Let's put the rain in this. It's called Tambor. This is where you can drive your car onto the actual boat. It's beautiful years here. It's got hit at a checkpoint. Please pull me over and search my car for no reason other than the fact that I was driving on the road. So I was surprised about that because I hadn't seen that in Costa Rica before. Yeah they just pulled me over to the side, searched my entire car looking for something. I'm nothing but I was like what is going on here because there was no probable cost to stop me other than the fact that I was driving at the car. I had my license, my passport and everything. So there you go. Here we are going across Tempiaza, a real Colorado. You see the big bridge here? All right on the way to Monteverde here we're off highway one at hand. We're going through a town called Las Wundas and this is about an hour and a half away from La Taberre de La Wundas. We are now at the top of the mountains on our way to Monteverde. Very high up here in lots of wind but it's much cooler up here than down below. Wow. Looking down towards the Gulfo of Nacoya. Look at that. Wow beautiful. Yes so here we are. With a great view this mirador this lookout point. Actually someone's building a house here but you can see the Gulf of Nacoya down there. Lots of fires going on because here in January it's actually considered their summer because winter starts from May until November so it's a dry season. Lots of fires going down there. Well it's about lunchtime so we're going to stop at Cafe Orizante. Let's see what they got going on in here. Let's put this out on right here. All right this is called the A-frame house here. Put it upstairs. There's two bedroom. It's perfect. And then you step outside you've got a jacuzzi which I'll be firing up here in a minute. And while in Monteverde what I ended up doing was a nighttime jungle safari hike. Doing a night walk this is called the Kinkajau. Nocturnal night walk starting at 5.30. It's $33 a person. Let's go see what's in here. Right before the night walk we got a rainbow. Look at that. And walking gave me a flashlight. So while I was out here I did see a Kinkajau. I also saw a two can that was sleeping. Several other birds of paradise animals that you would see out here. Also a frog and a little snake along with a tarantula. So you never know what kind of creatures are out here but you'll definitely see some animals. So here we are at the Salvatore Adventure Park where they have the canopy walk. They also have the swath sanctuary and butterfly garden. We're going to go check out some of the activities here. Let's go inside. So the price to visit the sloth sanctuary alone is going to be $39 but if you want it to see the butterfly garden and some of the other activities that they have here you can bundle them together. It just depends what you want to see. So if you want to see sloth sanctuary and butterfly garden it's $79 per person for a 90-minute tour. In Spanish a butterfly is called the Mariposa in case you didn't know that now you do but here they actually do have cocoons although the butterflies here cannot actually hatch because it's illegal in Costa Rica to actually have the hatchery as well as the butterflies in the same place. So they have to actually import the butterflies and then they have to get rid of these cocoons. They can't actually hatch the caterpillar into a butterfly here at this sanctuary. Interesting fact, right? So after you actually go into the butterfly sanctuary then you can go check out the sloths. I actually really enjoyed seeing all these sloths in case you're wondering where they get the sloths. Well they're usually animals that have been injured in the wild. Maybe they've been injured by a car, a motorbike or by another animal. Some of them are blind. So you know you never know what kind of accident happened to one of these sloths but that's why they're here and they can't be released back into the wild and the reason I bring this up is because people do want to know that. Another thing that's popular doing Monteverde is these hanging bridge hikes. Also they have a frog zoo or a frog exhibit that you can check out. So many different activities in Monteverde but the big thing is it's just a very beautiful cloud forest here. Now from Monteverde I'm actually headed to La Fortuna and along the way here you can see they've got these giant windmills which are covered in appears to be some algae or moss. Maybe mold but yeah just a freeze into La Fortuna now. It's been raining so I couldn't really film anything but the rain has kind of slowed down a bit as I've gotten towards La Fortuna going away from the coast even more now but it's very beautiful out here. So as you can see I'm at Lake Earnall now very windy here they have winds certainly as you would have had in the wild. It's like a lot of levels flow because it's dry season. That drive from Monteverde to La Fortuna takes about two and a half hours so as you can see on this route so far we've gone from Liberia we landed went to Papagayo then went down to Nacoya then crossed over from Nacoya to Monteverde and now we're into La Fortuna so you guys are getting an idea of how this route would go. Now even though it was very dry in Guanaquaste in particular around Nacoya and Papagayo where it was dry season up here it was raining pretty much off and on all days. Costa Rica has a lot of micro climates. Well we're officially very close to Earnall. La Fortuna is known for Ego Tremales which is the hot spring. Excuse me, excuse me, human coming through. Now this particular hot spring hotel was called Cacoro Mineral Springs and the hotel Villa was around 125 dollars per night. Now there are several different Ego Tremales hot spring areas that you can hang out. Not all of them are hotels and you can actually pay the entrance fee to go see some of these beautiful ones that are world famous. So here I am now at Ego Tremales beautiful clear hot spring. Now at Columbus hot springs. But while here in La Fortuna you can also do whitewater rafting and canoeing which is very popular to a chocolate farm. They have the sloths here as well. So doing a hike up Earnall volcano or doing a tour around there plus to do even the lake. Now let's just do a quick recap of where we're at in this journey. So I would say here in La Fortuna plan for about two to three days. Monta Verde you could do it in 24 hours but I would suggest 48 hours. Nacoya I would say spend around five days that begins in Nosara and then if you wanted to do Papagayo I would say two to three days there should be fine. So as you can see just to do this route you're probably going to need about 10 to 14 days. However if you're on a time crunch and all you want to see is a lot of places you can really do about one to two days in each one of these places and you don't have to really relax. You can move pretty quickly and you could probably do this trip in about seven days. And the good news is from La Fortuna you can get to Liberia's airport in about three hours or you could get to San Jose's airport in about three hours. So either way you're close to both main airports. Well I'm leaving La Fortuna and I'm actually headed towards San Jose but in between there is going to be a place called Poaz volcano which is actually where I'm looking to stop at the lookout point. So we'll see if I can get there on time. And now we're climbing the mountain. This is the mountain to get to San Jose. Poaz volcanoes nearby so they'll take 25 kilometers which is going to take a run in an hour. Oh wow. Wow. Look at that. It looks like we're almost to the top and there was clouds on the way up but once you get to the top it's above the clouds. That's cool. Basically at the top of the mountain here. For six kilometers I'll drive this road. This is a national park. Cool. It's gently up here. There's some big mountains. Well I came all the way from La Fortuna to Poaz volcano and I got to night because I don't have a reservation. So if Poaz volcano was something you wanted to see you need a reservation. The guy said that it probably isn't the best time anyway because it's cloudy but I'm assuming it's always cloudy over here. So not a very good situation for me. I came all the way over here for this. That's all good. Either way once you cross over the mountain where Poaz is and other volcanoes you end up looking down towards San Jose. So you've crossed the ridge. The other side is La Fortuna and on this side we have San Jose and the valley. All right we'll hold our officially headed down the mountain here. Quickly losing altitude. Now from San Jose here. Now once you get to San Jose obviously you're in the capital so it's going to be the metropolis of the Costa Rican country. Here you're going to find lots of traffic and it's not so easy to drive a rental car around San Jose as at least not as easy as it is going around the countryside. So keep that in mind. There is a central area to San Jose and then if you stay outside of there you're in Aluela which is one of the more popular areas for hotels. So I would say plan for about 24 hours in San Jose no matter what. Now just some population statistics to share with you. The city of San Jose has around 350,000 but if you include the metro area of San Jose it's around 2.5 million. All of Costa Rica has around 5.1 million people here. So it's a pretty small country in terms of size and also in terms of population although with so many different areas to explore Costa Rica feels a lot bigger even though it's very condensed. Now the second biggest city in Costa Rica is called Cartago. We're actually not going to go there but it's about an hour drive away from San Jose and it's south. Now from San Jose you either have a choice. You can go towards the Caribbean side or you can go towards the Pacific side. In this case what we're actually going to do is we're going to go towards Haco very briefly stop through there and that's where we're going to go towards Manuel Antonio right after that. But before we do that I'm going to give you a little tour of the Hilton double tree here in San Jose in case you're looking for a hotel. The prices do vary depending on supply and demand. You could get it for around $220 a night but this is what it looks like nice resort right here in San Jose. But yeah let's head down towards Haco which is about an hour and a half away here they're going to have a casino. It's actually one of the main party towns I don't spend too much time here but if you wanted to stop by for lunch that would be great although some people spend their whole time in Costa Rica in Haco. Now about an hour north of Haco there is some interesting wildlife activities you can do like going out on a crocodile tour because as you know they do have big crocodiles here and one of the places you can go is to Rio Tarcoles so they have boat trips you can do right here and I would say this is about 35 to 40 minutes north of Haco they also have the famous crocodile bridge. All right so from Haco we're going to go south this time we're in Manuel Antonio. Now Manuel Antonio is known as probably the premier place for wildlife spotting you're going to have three different types of monkeys here also you'll see several different types of sloths so there is two species of sloths there are wild here there's the tuto and the three-toed slot although I think here in Manuel Antonio you only see one of those because one is in Monteverde which is different than the one that's in the lower lands so take that into consideration but in Manuel Antonio it's really an amazing place and people like to go to that airplane restaurant. And now if you go south a bit from Manuel Antonio you come to Uvita which is known as the Wales Tale because it's a rock formation that extends out into the ocean in the shape of a whale but the interesting thing is they actually do get a lot of whales that are down here and that's why they call it the Bellina so Bellina in Spanish means whale and that's why they call it that but it's Bellina State Park National Park area so definitely do explore around Uvita they also have these waterfalls out here nice hotel resorts we did glamping while we were here I do recommend doing some glamping in Costa Rica just because it's more of an immersive experience in the jungle. And here is a look at the Bellina State Park that you go out to it is an emission fee that does have to be paid per car or per person that price varies you would want to look that up online before you go there but it's not a lot it's just something you have to pay in order to access and this is a look at Casado which is a traditional Costa Rican dish usually served for lunch or dinner but the word Casado translates to married basically marrying a variety of different foods includes rice also plantains some form of egg or a meat and yeah that's Casado. Here in Dominicol you can see we had parrots good close up with the parrots you can hear them from a distance now from the Pacific side we're going to explore a little bit around the Caribbean side we didn't have much time to explore Caribbean because it's on the other side but it doesn't mean that it's not worth being explored this here is Porto Viejo the interesting thing if you go a little bit further south you're in Bocoste, El Toro above here is going to be a place like Cauita and then the main city on the Caribbean is Lomon most people suggest just passing through there if you wanted to go a little bit further north of here you would come to a place that's called Tortuga National Park or Tortugero I should say and they say it's very beautiful there so lots to see on the Caribbean side here so to do a full trip like this in Costa Rica where you actually include the actual Caribbean you're looking at around two weeks minimum and that's moving quite quickly if you want it to actually chill in places like La Fortuna maybe Manuel Antonio or even Nicoia for a little bit longer then you're looking at around three weeks to possibly a month the good news is you're going to get a long-term visa I believe it's 180 days don't quote me on that because the writing in the passport wasn't very clear but it looked like a 180 and I looked online and it said 180 so you will have enough time the trick here is getting the rental car and doing it alone like this if you did a tour it might be a lot more efficient I guess you could say but I don't know if it's going to be your speed especially if you're with a family but if you're with a family rental car is probably the best way to go so as you can see the Caribbean side is a little bit different vibe they've got these two tubes they don't have those on the Pacific side at least not that I saw but either way really an awesome country as you can see I highly recommend Costa Rica try to at least do seven to ten days your first time if you really want to do this tour and see it as much as we did this is almost everything the only thing we didn't include was Corcovado in the south of the Pacific and Ketsal in the middle of the country as well as some of the other volcanoes but we really included most of the main things that you would need to see and if you enjoyed this one you can also watch our Panama City Panama video as well as our Belize video so we'll see you on those next
