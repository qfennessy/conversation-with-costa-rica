This is Costa Rica and so is this and so is this. We're Jamie and Skylar and we recently spent eight days road tripping in this ridiculously beautiful country and while Costa Rica may be small it's absolutely huge on adventure with countless hikes, waterfalls, beaches and views packed in a country the size of West Virginia. We spend our eight days in Costa Rica trying to see as much of it as possible and in this video series we're going to take you along for the ride from the scenic hikes to the terrifying lows. Three. Oh my gosh, I'm going to get somewhere else. And everywhere in between. This first doesn't even have rails on it. The first day of our Costa Rica adventure began at the Orlando Airport where we'd be boarding a direct flight on spirit airlines to Costa Rica's capital and by far its largest city San Jose. Now Spirit gets a bad rat from some people because it's a budget carrier, the cabins aren't the most spacious and you don't get an included carry on bag or drinks and snacks but we got our flights with Spirit for just around $220 round trip per person and we usually have pretty good luck with them and this flight was no exception as we boarded on time and touched down in San Jose around 20 minutes before our scheduled arrival time. As you can probably tell I was pretty excited to be back in Costa Rica. So after around a 2.5 hour flight from Orlando and about 40 minutes in customs we are now waiting for our shuttle to pick up our rental car and then we'll be on the road. Now while we show you a bit of footage driving through San Jose we want to point out that we reserved our 8 day rental car ahead of time through price line for just over $220. We did have to pay an additional 200 or so for liability insurance as our Geico policy did not cover rental cars abroad. We did not have to purchase collision insurance though as we booked the car using our Chase business card which has built in collision coverage. A pretty amazing feature which has saved us a lot of money. Budget did initially try to give us a 2 wheel drive vehicle but after pointing out that we had clearly paid for a 4 wheel drive SUV they did give us a vehicle with all wheel drive which as you'll see later would really come in handy. Thankfully we made it out of San Jose before dark but our adventure didn't end there as we'd still have around 40 miles of narrow mountain roads to get to our first Airbnb. Ok so we're stopping because we have to wait for traffic to come to this bridge. But in typical Costa Rica fashion even while waiting in nighttime traffic we had a waterfall view. It's snowing is pretty bumpy. After a slow 2 hour drive through some less than ideal driving conditions we finally reached our country Airbnb which made us feel right at home. But before hitting the bed we made a quick drive to nearby Venetia to grab some groceries at Economas and perhaps the best fast food chicken we've ever tasted at Poyolandia. Hi Jimmy I'm talking about how good the chicken is. 12 pieces of this chicken cost us 6 dollars and 60 cents plus this drink. Great deal. Good morning guys this is our second day here in Costa Rica. It's 5.30 in the morning which is much earlier than we normally get up but as you can see it is very much daylight already and since the sunset is around 5 o'clock in the evening here we gotta get our days going early. Now we're eating a couple of the pastries that we got from the grocery store last night for breakfast as well as some instant cappuccino because we knew we'd be on the road today before the coffee shops open and we didn't know if our Airbnb would actually have a coffee machine or not. Now we don't know what either these are called but we asked the staff working what their favorite was and they chose this one and then we also chose this one because it looked like it might have caramel in it. We're gonna try the staff favorite first. Very good. Let's see what's inside. Very flaky. It's sweet but it's very good. How cute is this place. It's too bad we can't stay here a few more days. The sky is locking it up so we can head out. Bye little house. Alright, here we go. If you're enjoying this video so far and want to see many more Costa Rican adventures and more Costa Rican dogs, be sure to subscribe to our channel. It is day two here in Costa Rica and we are now two for two for arriving in Costa Rica and having to drive in the dark in the rain to our Airbnb. And in the mountains. And in the mountains but we made it and we cannot wait to show you more of this beautiful country. Our Sunday morning drive had his heading southbound towards the Poas volcano, a nearly 9,000 foot active volcano which has erupted 40 times since 1828. Along this drive we found a sign for a different waterfall at nearly every turn but we had one particular destination in mind and that was Cascadas, Posa, Azul. A group of several waterfalls including the largest waterfall located within the Bajo Stel Toro region which is known for being one of the most remote and beautiful areas of Costa Rica. After a few miles of driving down some pretty sketchy but extremely beautiful roads, we were ready for the first of many big adventures on this trip. Now as you can see there are a ton of waterfalls on this property here. We have limited time today though so we are going to focus on getting to the last waterfall because we know we want to make it there and then along the way back we will show you as many as we can. Oh my gosh, already got mud on myself. I didn't even look like it was that muddy but I guess it is. I would say there is more restrooms and changing rooms, just a short walk from the reception area and they also have these cabins. We can hear people down there. I think that's the first waterfall. There might be a slide down that way. I'm sure Skyler would want to go down all the way back. On the way back. Yep. Alright. So for my research it sounds like you can easily spend an entire day here and I already see why we have already passed trails to probably three or four different waterfalls. Each of them seemed to require a little bit of a hike so if you want to visit every one of the waterfalls on this property I can see how you could easily spend an entire day here. So the wide grassy path has now turned into a more narrow rocky path that goes into the forest. The stairs have started, I did read that coming back up these stairs is the hardest part of the whole trail. I think we're really thankful for these hiking sticks right now because these stairs are muddy and there's a lot of them so the sticks definitely going to help us stay upright and hopefully save our needs as well. What is happening across the river? You get to go on that? Yep. What? Oh my gosh, I'm so excited. As you can probably tell I did pretty much all the planning on this trip and I think Jamie is going to be in for a lot of surprises. Oh my gosh, this is crazy. So Skylar just informed me that we're going to get to go across the river on this thing. It's not that far of a fall. Oh my gosh. Now you can also go down there and walk across on the rocks but you know we're going to do this. Alright get in. Oh my gosh. Are we going to do it together or just go down? No, together. Together? Yeah. We could do it one at a time. I'm not going to be kind of cool. Okay, we'll do it one at a time. I'm not in here yet. Oh my gosh. Piece of cake, right? I don't know, we'll see whenever I'm over the middle part of it. And you go fast here please. Hey, I'm going to enjoy it. I think we both could have fit in here but it would have been a tight fit. Alright, so I am stopped in the middle over this river. Here's a view from my little basket on the one side. Here's Skyler over there, recording something. And there's Skyler's side of the river. Now I got to pull myself over there. This is a pretty cool surprise. I had no idea that we'd be able to do this out here today. Obviously Skyler knew and he was keeping it a secret. Let's get a little hard at the end. Alright. I am out and now it's the back over there. I think I got Skyler. He's really much faster than I was. Oh look, he made it. It's a nice ride, huh? With the river crossing behind us, it was time to hike the rest of the way to the furthest waterfall, which unfortunately meant climbing up and down a lot more stairs. I hope we're here in November. It's like the end of the rainy season. Everything is so green. All these rocks are just full of moss. Just so you guys all know, this is what the stairs you got to deal with look like. They're pretty good stairs. Some of them are taller than others and they're definitely wet and muddy. But going up on what I'd say is much safer than coming down because coming down you have the slip-race. I would say they're not too physically taxing. Just take your time and be careful on the mud to make sure you don't fall. We made it to the big lookout point, which makes me think we are pretty close to the big falls already. We'll find out soon. There's a lot of leaf cutters. Oh, leaf cutters? Okay. You can probably see a lot of moving leaves down there. That's because they're being carried by ants, which I believe are known as leaf cutters. We do remember from our last time in Costa Rica that these ants definitely do bite and you do not want to walk through them. So if you see these guys, make sure you step over them. We made it to the bottom of all these stairs and hopefully no more stairs till the last waterfall. I think there's going to be some more. You think so? Yeah. We almost there yet. We're going to be close. We can't go down too much further, can we? So eventually the stairs did seem to end, but as you can see, it's more just natural stairs now. A lot of rocks and roots. But the good news is I'm not sure if you can hear, but the waterfall is getting pretty loud, so we're thinking we're close. All right, we seem to have made it to some sort of clearing now. I hope that means the waterfall is close. Stimmy is not as optimistic as I am, but I think it's right around the corner. You see it? Awesome. I thought you were going to show us. That's the polished waterfall we've ever seen in person by far, right? I know you're probably beginning to question it for a while, but what do you think? Where is it? Yeah, it's worth it. Oh my god. Yeah. Just feel that, man. Yep, that's what we came here for. At 508 feet tall, the Caterata Cayeda Nyeve Yipaz was easily the tallest waterfall we've seen in Costa Rica. But just a few days later, we visit one that was even taller, so make sure to tune into our future Costa Rica episodes so you don't miss that adventure. This is a massive waterfall. Skyler went down a little bit closer to the waterfall. Skyler looks so tiny compared to this giant waterfall, but I'm hanging out here just enjoying this from the falls. I will go down and join him shortly though. This is what Skyler lives for. Look at that waterfall. So I came down to where Skyler was, and now I am getting pretty wet. I just want to try again here and touch the waterfall. He got even closer to the fall, so I think we're probably going to be soaked. Oh, really wet here. But pretty freaking cool view. I can already tell. We want him to come back that he is soaked. So we started this day not even knowing for sure if we'd be able to come to this waterfall because we did pass a sign saying that it was closed on Sunday. Thankfully it wasn't though, and that sign may be part of the reason why we actually have this place all to ourselves. And as you can see, it is massive and it is awesome. Now the hike here was pretty challenging, and I was beginning to question whether or not it was worth it. This hike was a lot of work, but it's definitely worth it. But as soon as I saw this waterfall, I knew it was. Now I'm not sure, but I think what we went across the river on that part is just a path where that waterfall is. Alright, we'll see you at the top. Taking a quick break, getting mentally prepared for these stairs. There's a lot of them. Yeah. After a few minutes of exhausting, mostly uphill hiking, we arrived at the Miradoras, a great spot to snap a few photos. Alright, we made it back to the little screen crossing here, which is 155 meters from the waterfall. And it looks like back there where thinking is a lookout. Hopefully we can see the top of the waterfall from the sea. I'd say this is the top of the waterfall. Now if this hike is a little too challenging for you, you won't be able to see the waterfall from the bottom, but as long as you're not afraid of heights, you will be able to see it from the top. The cart is occupied, coming over, so we're taking this route back. There you got three people in there. Really destined to get to that cart. Alright, we've got some more waterfalls to show you. And we're happy to inform you that the remaining waterfalls were all much easier to access. And while none of them compared in size to our first waterfall stop, they still could play to offer, including a spot for a skiler to get in his shower for the day. With two stops down, it was time to move on to number three, which offered a smaller waterfall and a nice calm spot for swimming. And for those who are a little more adventurous, it's here that you can also do some cliff jumping. An opportunity which skiler can never pass up. Alright, this is a little bit scary. But the first of several cliff jumps on this trip in the books. It was time to move on to waterfall number four. So this is another pool that you can swim in. Like we said earlier, you could stay here all day if you wanted to. So there is a water slide. But as you can see, there is not a whole lot of water flowing down it. And it's also made out of concrete. It looks more painful than fun I think. I know, I didn't do it because I was going to be good for my back. We got more waterfalls still today. We got a big hike tomorrow. And this looks like it could be a potential tailbone injury. Yeah, very fast. Going on to the next spot. Our final waterfall at cascadas, Poso Azul, was the smallest of the five, but also the closest to the entrance. While it was a beautiful and calming spot, we were starting to get a bit tired and hungry. So it was time to be on our way. So just as we finished our waterfall, hikes had started raining. Our timing couldn't have been much better. Now the food that they're cooking at this place does smell amazing, but I think we're going to hit a little bit down the road towards our next waterfall destination. Oh my god! Woo! I'm going to try to find some food along the way. I think the sign that said it was closed Sunday was for blue falls and not the actual waterfall that we just came from. So, it makes a lot more sense to us now. Yeah. Can't go to blue falls on Sunday, but you can't go to Azul. What's the one we went to? It was like the Azul. I don't know how to look at the name of it. The one we went to had Azul in the name, which also means blue, right? So, use it a mix them up. Well, we may have been quite confused about where we had come from. We did know exactly where we were going, at least for our next stop. So it's still raining. We decided to stop off at this coffee shop that we passed by on our way to the next waterfall. And we have the view of the volcano. It is so pretty up here. Ready for coffee? Although there weren't many options for coffee in this remote area of Costa Rica, the reviews for this spot were good. And almost anything would be better than the instant cappuccino we had earlier in the morning. Our first real Costa Rican coffee on the trip. What do you think? Better than our cappuccino this morning. Since we can't survive on coffee alone, we decided to order some traditional Costa Rican casados too, which came out looking amazing and tasting even better. Well, for now, it is only sprinkling. We are going to head out to our next waterfall and we'll see what the conditions are like when we get there. So it is now pouring down rain. Time ain't worked in our favor today, because yeah, we would have been at the bottom of that waterfall and still had to hike up all those muddy stairs. Like a rock, would you see it up there? Yeah, I do. Oh my gosh. Hot hole? Yeah. We're on over a bridge. I think that we're probably driving up that road, right? Yeah. Oh my gosh. That looks straight up. Well, driving to the Costa Rican mountains can be a bit intimidating. It can also be a whole lot of fun. Provided you have a four-wheel drive vehicle with good ground clearance and or not in any sort of hurry. Would you drive in the Costa Rican mountains or would you stick to buses and taxis? Let us know in the comments. This bird doesn't even have rails on it. It's open. What a task of day truth is. I don't know. I don't see. No? Yeah, why? I don't know that I want to find out. I don't even know any of those words mean. Plus, Skyler uses our Google Translator. I want to show you this bridge again that we have to drive over. It has absolutely no railings. We got to figure out what test good day true chas means. Oh, just like a fish for me? Trout fishing. All right. I said we can probably skip the trout fishing. Yeah. We can skip the trout fishing. All right. No trout fishing for us, I guess. We'll try to find another waterfall instead. Let's go back over this bridge. Hopefully, please. All right. So this next waterfall stop, Skyler has GPS coordinates. Sometimes those are great. Sometimes those lead us to who knows where. So stick around to find out where we're going. At least we got two hours before it gets dark. Yeah, we've got time and it's only supposed to be two minutes away. Oh, back to the rocky road. All right. Here we go. From concrete to rock. We're heading for some wiggle in the round. So we are currently turning around. So these coordinates, I guess, led us to a farm. There's no sign of this waterfall anywhere. This is the **** road I've ever seen in my life. And there's this farm at the end of it on the side of the volcano. That was pretty cool. This drive was very pretty, but quite muddy and bumpy. But still, Skyler loves driving around on these roads. The more remote the better. Oh, this is crazy. I can't think we've ever come across this before. Hi. You never know what you might see back road, mountain driving, and coastering. Yeah. We're going to have to make these under the wind. Holy crap. We're taking this for Skyler and we would like never go to any of these places because I'd be so nervous to drive over them. I would see it and just be like, all right, we're turning around. Even when it's raining, it's so pretty here. Look. Oh, pesky day true, trust. Not a waterfall. I don't know why it was a full one. There's another time over there and that one has a fish. Oh, yeah. Yeah. All right, well, let's go right. So at this point, we're pretty much just driving around aimlessly. Basically, we just decided we'd keep driving down this main road. Hit one of the other. Water falls up, but then we saw a sign for a national park. And it looked like the road to the national park also led into the mountains. And we thought it'd be cool to check out. So we remember following GPS coordinates to just following signs on the road. We're about to find out if these signs are even accurate. I don't know if you can tell how bumpy it is. I don't know, is it going to lead us to a national park? What do you think? I mean, that's what the signs say. It is what the signs say. I don't really like the international park. I haven't seen a house for like two miles. Right. It would have been absolutely no other signs. It looks like the road ends ahead. So I'm going to let you know what we find. All right. So this led to a sign that said camping and volcano views. The map doesn't show that there's even a road here. So I probably shouldn't take it. I kind of want you. I know you do, but gosh, without a little bit more planning, we're probably going to have to turn around. So GPS coordinates, we struck out following red signs. We struck out. I don't think we struck out on either of them, actually. They were not where we planned on going, but I'm not saying that we still didn't have a good time, but they didn't get us to where we thought we were going to go. Slow, my new waterfalls are ready. I'm honestly not even that excited about going and seeing one especially in the rain. Yeah, I'll just go do something else. We found another waterfall. This is not quite as big or as pretty. While we had to give up on waterfall chasing for this day, we weren't too disappointed. As we knew, we had several more waterfall adventures ahead of us, all of which will be included in our future Costa Rica episodes. And if you want to make sure that you don't miss out on them, be sure to subscribe to the Explorcation and turn the notifications on. I think we decided that we are going to head towards our Airbnb because it's almost a two hour drive. And if something pops up along the way that draws us in, then we'll stop. I think this sign is up for the accurate depiction of the roads. Definitely going into the clouds. I thought we were at the top of the volcano and then we just came here to go straight up for another two miles. Wow, we are in a cloud. There are these mountain cows out here. That's crazy to see them. I'm not even driving, but I'm like tensing all my muscles just because of the driving conditions. So thank you for driving out of my way. You never get to see any of these places. Look at this cow. I mean, how do you get up here? So the fog finally cleared up just long enough to get this view from the side of the road. Look at that. Wow. Even cloudy and stormy. Just gorgeous. Now after 4 p.m. and only around an hour before sunset, we'd have to get moving to avoid having to drive through San Jose in the dark because as much as we love driving through the Costa Rican countryside, we hate driving through San Jose. I was forget how much I love driving in these mountains, whether it's Costa Rica or Puerto Rico or San Jose. Oh, you can. Oh, yeah. That was close. In 200 meters, continue straight. Due to the less than ideal driving conditions and a couple of traffic jams, we didn't make it to our Airbnb before dark, but we did make it there in one piece. So we ended up stopping by a grocery store and grabbing these taco things out of the freezer. We decided to just come here and cook them up because honestly, we were a little excited about getting here and we'll show you why after we're done eating. You did pretty good. Ticitos are a good decision. So this is why we were really excited to get to our Airbnb because it has a view of San Jose. But that does mean we had to go through San Jose traffic, which can be crazy, but it was totally worth it. And I think in the morning, we're probably going to have a view of some mountains over there. Good morning. We woke up to all sorts of nature sounds, birds, chickens, dogs, and this view of the mountain. Sky says that's the one that we're going to be hiking today. That looks pretty high. When we got up this morning, you could see the peak, but already the clouds have moved in. And over here is a view of the city. We pretty much booked this Airbnb for this view, but after we got here and saw how nice it was for $50 a night, we kind of wish we were staying a few more days. But once again, we're going to have to get going early for a hike. We're good to head out. Alright. Our third day in Costa Rica started off in search of the trailhead de Pico Blanco. Our starting point for our hike to the nearly 8,000 foot high peak. Once again, we were relying on GPS coordinates, which let us down another bad road to another pretty remote area. So we drove up this crazy road and we talked to a nice woman up there who said that we can park our car here. Thank goodness though that Skylar has that translator app. So we do think some people probably drive further up on this road, but I'm glad we didn't try it. Oh yeah, look at this area here. It's pretty rough. So we were a little bit bummed that we didn't find walking sticks at this trailhead like we did on our hike yesterday, but it didn't take us too long of hiking up this trail to find some pretty good ones on the side of the path. So we're about half a mile into our hike to Pico Blanco. It's a five and a half mile loop trail and depending on who you ask, it's either moderately difficult or very difficult, probably depending on your experience level and also the conditions of the trail, how muddy it is and how much it has been raining that day. So we did just need a mountain biker on this path. He didn't speak any English, but we could understand that he said Pico Blanco was that tall peaks straight in front of us, so we're definitely on the right path. We are in the end of rainy season right now, but it seems that it stays pretty dry in the morning generally and then sometime in the afternoon, you do get some pretty heavy rains. We're starting this hike just a little after 8 a.m. and it's supposed to be a four hour hike or so, so that would put us back around noon and hopefully we'll beat the rains. We definitely do not want to be hiking down the mountain when it's pouring rain. So this part of the trail, about two thirds of a mile in, is actually downhill and concrete. So we're definitely making some pretty good times here this section and we got a pretty amazing view over there as well. So this section of the hike around three quarters of a mile in is so beautiful. You got country views to the right and city views to the left both are equally scenic. Alright guys, we are about a mile into the hike now and here's the view we got of the city. We're getting a little higher and the views are getting a little better. And even looking straight forward is really beautiful. We just love this trail so far and there's Jamie way ahead of me because I've been stopping to take shots at the scenery and she is trying to maintain a pace which is probably good idea. So we've come to our first fork here. This is a path that we have to go down and to the left is another little trail. We have no idea where that goes. Alright, we've encountered our first almost straight up section. Now it is starting to feel like a hike. Definitely some really steep spots. A lot of clay. You can tell it's rained pretty recently but it's not super slick. It would definitely get slick real quick if it were to start raining though. So keeping our fingers crossed that the rain is hold off today. Now those of you who know our channel know that typically Jamie does talk a lot more in our videos but she is just focused on keeping up a good pace on this trail and I do not blame her because we do not want to be coming back in the rain. Jamie, mile and a half in, what are you thinking of the hike so far? It's a little more challenging than I expected it to be starting off. We haven't even reached the loop yet. As you can tell I am definitely pretty out of breath too so I can't say it's not challenging but also we are trying to keep a really good pace. So I'd say we're hiking a little faster than we normally would and we're filming. So the combination of trying to hike fast and filming along the way definitely makes it a little harder. Makes you burn a little more energy than you probably would otherwise. I'm still enjoying it though. You do definitely want to wear your best hiking shoes on this hike because you will want that extra grip. Jamie also does recommend a hiking stick and I think I agree with that. This guy that has let us to the loop trail where we have to decide to go left or right. All trails says it's better to go left. If you keep going left it's a much more direct route to the top of the mountain. But if you just want the easiest way and you don't care about seeing the whole loop you could take the right route up and back down. And if you just really like to torture yourself I suppose you could take the left route up and down. So far the first section of the actual loop portion of the trail is very narrow. A little overgrown not too bad though. Definitely a little bit muddy not too slick yet. Overall not too bad. We reached a little bit of a clearing here. Looks like we'll have some views off to the left. We're probably about a mile and two thirds into the hike now. As you can see we got some more great views of San Jose. And the trails actually leveled out a little bit. Yeah hopefully we can really make some good time through this section because we know there's going to be much harder and slower sections coming up. Now as we continue to make our way towards the top of Pico Blanco we do want to mention another reason that we were really trying to complete this hike quickly. And that's because we'd be driving all the way to Uvita after the hike and we really wanted to take the scenic route. Windings are the inland mountains of Costa Rica. Route 2 is known for being one of the most beautiful drives in the entire country but also one of its most dangerous. In fact a section of route 2 between Cartaggo and San Ezigro is known as Saro de la Muerte or the Hill of Death as its steep winding roads or visibility and frequent rock falls can make it incredibly dangerous during poor weather conditions and at night. And since we were only willing to navigate the Hill of Death in the daylight we'd have to get the drive started early. So we're about two miles into the hike now I think and from the review we read a lot of people said once you get towards the top of the mountain you're probably not going to get many good views but we are getting close to the top of the mountain and look at these views that we got. If these aren't good I don't know what is. Best view of the hike yet. Yeah. Oh man I wish we had more time to enjoy it. I think the reason people say you don't get good views towards the top is because often times there are low clouds if we are two three hours later in the day. We probably wouldn't have a view right now but we really timed this right I think. Glad we got on the trail early. I think we're coming up to the two mile mark here which means we gotta be getting close to the summit. We can walk in through this really thick brush and these are just here. How cool is that? Giant palo plants. Yeah. We weren't expecting that. No. We're starting to get overgrown again here. We've been seeing a lot of this in the last quarter mile or so but there's also blood of flies flying all over even though it's overgrown. It's still pretty scenic. This kind of came out of nowhere. I was not expecting this but check this out. Oh wow yeah. What do you think? My gosh. You got flowers over to your left. This is a great view. And then look to the right. Wow. Yeah. I don't know if you can see this on camera at all but we can see our breath when we breathe up here which I know the temperature isn't cold enough like that happens all the time where we're from in the Midwest in the winter where you can see your breath when it's really cold. It can't be less than 70 degrees or so right here. We can definitely see our breath. If any of you out there know why that is let us know. It's starting to get a lot more humid. I think we're getting into the section of the trail that is frequently in the clouds because even though it's not actively raining the trail is getting much more wet. The pace has come down. Last mud. The last little bit of this hike to the summit probably less half-mile or so I'd say. The sky is pretty steep and we're having to go pretty slow and we're still really out of breath. Lots of down trees in this section. So you do have areas like this on the trail that are a little tricky. You've got to kind of use some climbing skills but they're pretty few on far between. So we're starting to be able to see big patches of sky ahead. That's a good sign. Oh. I think we made it. Look above you. Oh. Oh. Oh my god, I had no idea. I don't know how happy. That was kind of anti-climactic. I didn't even realize we were here for the first 10 seconds. You're just catching your breath, huh? Yeah. Thank goodness for that sign. We do not read Spanish but we're pretty certain that that says we've reached the summit or the peak. Something along those lines. It doesn't look like there's much for views around here. So we probably won't be spending too much time here. Just long enough to scarf down a cliff bar and some water and start heading back. Yeah. All right. Good job. Good job to you. I would say this is a difficult hike. I would. I'd say it's the second or third hardest hike we've ever done. Because of the chips. What are these things are? And these. Incliffs bars. Yeah, I don't know what that is but we're definitely not taking it. Now to leave to La Carria, East San Miguel. Overall, it took about two and a half hours to hike 2.8 miles up the mountain. But we agreed that we probably could have done it in under two if we hadn't been filming. And since the hike back would involve more downhill hiking and less filming, we were hopeful that it would go much more quickly. And head back down the mountain. All right. Skyler left his stick at the top. But thankfully we did not get too far. Very. It became me long to realize I was missing something. Yeah, something that you're definitely going to need on the way down. Yes. Because look at this mud. It does look like the clouds are starting to roll in. Thank goodness we're on our way down now. So far the hike down has been very muddy. But I think we're keeping a pretty good pace. It's much less strenuous. We're not breathing heavy like at all. But more muddy. Definitely more muddy. Definitely got to be careful. You don't want to slip in the mud and fall off the edge of the mountain. I'd say coming down is easier but also more dangerous. If we can maintain this pace the rest of the way back, we'll be back in an hour. But I have a feeling it's not going to be all like this. Lots of ferns in this section of the trail. Oh, I love ferns really so much. Yeah, we've reached the fern-golly portion of the trail. Kind of steep, kind of muddy, but pretty leisurely. Yeah. Oh, wow, we got another awesome viewpoint up here. Oh my god. Check out this deep point. Haven't checked all trails in a while. I'm guessing about half a mile down from the summit. Yeah, so even though we are in the clouds, you can still see the city very well. Yeah. Man, I feel like we are hiking this on the perfect day though. Yeah. We had great views the whole way. It's nice and cool up here. We got in the clouds a little bit, but no rain. Even if it does rain, hopefully we'll be well over halfway down by the time it does. This might change, but so far, the trail down is significantly less strenuous. So I think that if somebody wanted to hike up to that point, you could go out and back on this side of it. It wouldn't be near a strenuous, but I also don't think you would see near as many great views along the way. We've reached our first nice lap part of the hike on the side. Yeah. Yeah, this is a nice change. Another nice change about the hike back was that we spotted several red paint trail markers on the trees, which let us know we were on the right path back without having to constantly check our all trails app. Hello, can you go? Oh my god. I don't want to go this way. All right, I made it. More graceful than me. I'm going to go very graceful. It's a good news. Not only did we find another trail marker, but we found a nice view right next to it. This is another area that is just totally different from the rest of the hike. I love this area. So cool. Yeah, it's like you're in a different world. So sections of this trail going down do have this barbed wire fence directly to the left of you. So you want to be extra careful not to slip because if you were to slip and fall into that barbed wire, that would be bad news. I guess it'd be better than falling off the edge of a cliff, but it still would be far from good. You could easily go off the edge. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be a bit of a fall. Good thing the barbed wire would stop you. I don't know where maybe it's mile and I have to two miles down the mountain now and we're starting to hear some running water. It almost sounds like a waterfall. You obviously know we've already seen a lot of waterfalls and plan on seeing a lot more while we're here in Costa Rica, but based on the sound of it, we might get to see one that we weren't expecting to see. Just a little stream. All right. Well, I'm glad I wore my waterproof socks right now. Jamie's going to have to try to not walk in the water. She doesn't compare to the waterfalls we saw yesterday, but it's still a nice unexpected surprise. So on this side, you don't have use of the city, but you have use of this. So I think we were like somewhere up there, probably in the thick of those trees. I know initially we said there's not as good of views on this side of the loop, but we've really hit a section here where we got some really nice views for us. Pretty extended period of time. We're going over there. Another great view. Yeah, these do not get old. Nope. It's nice that they're scattered along the trail too. We got to hide here far. Might just do a few thinking, oh, that we're closer. All right, guys, we completed the loop. We made it back. Yeah. Well, we're not done yet. We still got to hike the non-loop portion back to our vehicle, but we've definitely completed the hard part. Up up. Yeah. So I think we only got a little over a half mile to go now, and we just heard our first thunder. Thankfully, it did sound like it was a ways away. We definitely could still get rained on, but if we do, it would definitely suck, but we're very confident we're going to get back in one piece. We are almost back to the car, and look at these clouds. We are hearing some thunder. The rain will be coming soon. I'm going to have to get the case. Yeah, keep hearing that thunder. Yeah. At this point, I think we'd both rather be walking uphill than down. So pretty steep hill ahead, but that's OK. I know. One thing we didn't mention is that we didn't see any other people on our hike. Maybe there's a reason for that. Maybe we're crazy for hiking this trail when we did during the rainy season. I don't know, but thankfully everything went really well. That is our rental straight ahead. It is still there. There is a chicken under it, but it's there. All right. That's great. We have a chicken here. There's still one chicken here. As crazy as it sounds, the second we got back to the car, it started sprinkling. Yeah. I think they said we got back just in time. All right, guys. So we thought we were making a really good pace. We thought we'd be back by noon or maybe one at the latest, but we didn't get back till 2 o'clock because we didn't get back to the car till 2. We're not going to be able to do the drive through the mountains. We're not going to be able to go on the death hill because we would be driving through it in the dark, which sounds very unsafe from what I've read. We're hoping that we still might be able to drive that mountain road on the way back to San Jose, but we're really hoping you enjoyed this hike and we'll see you in Uvita. While it doesn't have the mountain views that you'll find along route 2, the drive along route 34 is pretty beautiful in its own right. Now, because we did much of this drive in the dark and we were quite tired, we didn't film a whole lot of this drive, but we did still catch some pretty great views. Along the way, we grabbed some delicious key lime pie and much needed coffee at CaffeCitos and Oratina. We also stopped by an amazing fruit stand somewhere along route 34, where we sampled and purchased some tropical fruits. With the end of daylight approaching, we just had to drop by La Fiesta del Marisco. I was just telling Jamie how awesome it would be if we could find a bar along the beach to catch sunset because sunset is in like 15 minutes and then we came along this place. Perfect. Now we couldn't have timed it much better. The beaches here are so different than what we're used to. They are dark beaches. We've gathered at our sunset drinks. We asked if they had any fresh juice here and they had a congeuse from. I asked the waiter what his favorite was and he recommended pineapple juice with peppermint and I have never tried it before and it is delicious. After enjoying a couple drinks, along with our first beachfront sunset of the trip, we were back on the road and after grabbing a quick dinner just outside of Dementicao, we arrived at our Airbnb in the beautiful beach town of Iwita, where you can continue with us on our Costa Rican adventure by clicking here right now.
