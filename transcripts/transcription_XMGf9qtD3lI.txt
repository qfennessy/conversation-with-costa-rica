Welcome back to Costa Rica everybody and welcome to the final destination in this beautiful country. As you can see from behind us we've traded the mountains for the beach and we've headed down to Manuel Antonio which is on the Pacific coast. We're going to spend five full days here and we hope we'll be able to show you around what to do but eat your usual things. If you watch that for us on other videos back from Mexico then you know that we know the beach kind of people. We prefer the mountains and jungles and hikes. It's a great thing about Costa Rica is that you're never far from the mountains the jungles wildlife. It's like here in Manuel Antonio the jungle literally comes right down to the beach so you can go hiking in the morning and then chill on the beach in the afternoon. It's also one of the best places in Costa Rica to spot wildlife. We'd not seen a single monkey our entire two weeks in Costa Rica and then within like two hours of being here we just saw monkeys like right next to where we were staying. And this morning when we arrived to the beach we're literally spotted a slug just. I mean it's literally like just over there in the tree. We'll show you in a video. It's the closest one we've ever seen. Yeah on our own without a guide and our first destination is actually right behind us you can just about see it. So let's go. The number one place to see on any visit to Manuel Antonio has to be the Manuel Antonio National Park which is where we starting out tour of the area. This park is one of the top destinations in the entire country and for good reason. It combines all the best bits of Costa Rica and frozen together into the smallest and perhaps the most diverse national park in the country. You've got dense jungle that's absolutely teaming with life and apparently in this small area it's a little bit easier to catch some of the more elusive creatures. That's what we're hoping anyway. And when you're done with hiking and spotting wildlife you can head down to two of the most beautiful beaches in the country to relax in this tropical paradise. But more on those a little bit later. So we've just entered into Manuel Antonio National Park and before we start exploring there are a few things that you should know if you're wanting to visit this place. The interviews are sixteen dollars each without a guide if you want a guide and there'll be a bit more expensive. It's open every day but Tuesday between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. But it probably best to get air as early as possible so you can make the most of your ticket. Obviously make sure to be a very off-scammers that are apparently a lot of scammers if you come here with your private work or with the parking but also they're trying to sell you tickets as well to the parks. I think I'll stay where it tours. I like your tickets for the park. Thanks. Which you can't officially buy in person you have to do it online. We're going to start by walking as many of the trails here in the park as we can. There are six trails in total. They range in length from like 1.5 kilometers to a few hundred meters. They're all really well marked, easily accessible trails. Open to sort of everyone really. Hopefully we're going to have loads of cool animal encounters along the way. So much more wildlife. I can't believe you. How much we've seen in 10 minutes without a guy. Like this park absolutely wins already on another wildlife. So there's one animal that we just haven't seen yet in Costa Rica and that is a snake. Well we're not sure we want to see one too close. I don't mind seeing some but I want to see that very poisonous one. No yeah apparently here they have the feral ants which is the most deadly viper in in Costa Rica. We're keeping our eyes peeled but they're just really really hard to spot unless you get really lucky. We're just finishing up the trails now and they've been really good actually. Like a lot longer than I thought they were going to be. Maybe not that longer because of the heat. It takes you a little bit longer to walk around and it's quite like a lot of steps. The wildlife here is just crazy. We've seen like four or five times the amount we saw in any of the other parks and such a variety of different animals as well. So that is 100% worth your entry ticket right there just to see how many different animals there are. But we have worked up quite a sweat as we said doing these hikes. So I think it's about time we went and checked out the other half of what makes this park so special. So Mamal Antonio National Park actually has four different beaches that can only be accessed if you buy an entry ticket into the park and they are. So there's player Escondido which is just down at the bottom of this cliff over here and I don't think it is accessible to the public because it doesn't seem like there's any path down to it. So it's in the park but it might be protected in some way that's why you can't get to it. And then there's Clio Gamela. And the two most popular beaches by far are Espedia Sir Beach and Manual Antonio Beach which are on either side of the Cathedral Point Peninsula. If you could imagine a tropical paradise in your mind these beaches would be pretty close to what you would come up with. In fact Manual Antonio which you can see behind me was actually voted in the top 25 beaches in the world by the Trip Advice as Traveler's Choice Awards in 2019 so it's definitely got something special. So I think for the rest of the afternoon we're just going to chill on the beach, soak up the sunshine and enjoy this tropical paradise. As the sun began to set we headed back to the town of Cappos where we were staying and spend the evening down by the harbor to watch the incredible sunset out to sea. You've seen that they have some beautiful beaches in the Manual Antonio National Park. However you probably don't want to pay multiple entries just to go to the same beach again. No they do have lots of different beaches along the coastline here in Manual Antonio that are free to enter and they don't have to pay like a pretty expensive entry fee to access. And it is just as beautiful, not even pretty or actually. So we got here nice and early and the beach we're starting on is Espedia Norte Beach which is the same beach as one of the ones in Manual Antonio. It's just that part of the beach and there is obviously only able to access that in you via ticket. Welcome to Niagara Waterfalls or well at least the start of a six kilometer trail to the waterfall. Yeah nothing comes easy. We had a super early start this morning because the waterfalls are actually about a 45 minute drive down the coast from Cappos. Obviously we don't have a car so we had to get the local bus which takes probably just over an hour plus then from a place called Dominico. We had to get a taxi all the way up to the waterfalls which is like another 15 minutes and cost about $20 so. That was expensive although there are local buses which are a little bit in the lock post that will be linked below. So we're hoping to get one of those buses back when we when we return from the hike. You can also take a tour obviously but we were checking prices. That was crazy expensive. Yeah. $130 per person but if you're short of time and if you have the money to spend you can definitely take a tour. So we've arrived safely fairly easily to the waterfalls. Now we just got to do the six kilometer trek to them which is a pretty steep already. Yeah. We're not looking forward to the way back which will be probably around midday which is the hottest part of the day so. It's going to be pretty pretty tall. It's much easier to jump down together. This hill is like ridiculously steep. I really don't want to come back. One kilometer done. Bye, Mosul. We got to the start of the official trail. So actually two different entrances you can get into it. When we came to it's kind of the longest but it's definitely the cheapest one if you do it on your own. The other one was about $30 and cheapy. However it's only about a 30 minute walk but this one is only $10 per person to get into the waterfall but obviously it's a four or six kilometer hike depending on whether you have a vehicle or not. So basically this one offers you a bunch of different options. You can do the hike like Kitty said. You can also do horseback riding tour or a four by four tour that takes you down to the waterfall. Obviously you're going to pay more for that but you do have some different options here if you don't want to do the hike. It's really up to your personal preference which one you want to do. For us we just wanted to see the waterfalls and we're obviously tight on time because of the bus schedules. So we just wanted to get there and back sort of as quick and as cheaply as we could. The park is also open from 7am to about 3.34pm. Highly highly recommend coming here as early as you can in the morning because we got here at 8am and it's already pretty hot. Yeah it's boiling already. We're halfway there three more to go. One more kilometer. This is actually how far the Jeep comes up. Pretty much takes you all the way to the waterfall. Maybe we can sneakily get one back. There are actually two waterfalls at Nauyaka, the lower falls and the upper falls. We highly recommend heading straight down to the lower falls first in order to get your pictures in and dive straight into that refreshing pool after the long hike. You can even swim over to the waterfall for the ultimate power shower. Once you're done admiring the lower falls you can head back up and along the walkway towards the upper falls. From here you get a different perspective of falls and pool below and can climb up to get a closer look at the upper falls too. We're just starting our walk back from the waterfalls now. We had a okay amount of time there. We had about one and a half hours there. It's quite a good amount of time if you just go there to chill, swim a little bit, take a few photos. We did feel a little bit rushed and of course now we're like trying to push ourselves to get back to the entrance so we don't miss the bus that we want to catch. The waterfall's were 100% worth the effort. It's beautiful, the light on it was just amazing. Nearly like 11 o'clock so it's getting really really hot. It's not going to be a fun walk best. This is it. The hardest part. Actually the entire way back for the first four kilometers to the car park was actually pretty much all downhill. I didn't realize actually how much uphill we went on the way there. Just this last section, this last two kilometers is very steep. We've still got about an hour to get to the bus stop though. How far have we come? Oh it's just brutal. If you have a car, bring it car. This last section is disgusting. See the level of my sweat. Just beating sweat. Sweaty high five. Oh my gosh. Even if you don't have a car, just hire a car for the day. Even if it's more expensive, it's not worth climbing that hill. Oh yeah, great sense of achievement. Burnt about a million calories. We then waited for our bus back to Kepos for a while before it came and took us all the way back to the town. This is our last night in Manuel Antonio and one of our last nights in Costa Rica. Unfortunately. We've come down to the beach to watch the sunsets which I hope is going to be really nice. We really enjoyed our stay here in Manuel Antonio despite the heat. Yeah it's been fun. But honestly this was probably our favourite place in terms of wildlife. We're obviously not like beachy kind of people as we've said but the mixture of jungle and beach here sort gives you a bit of variety. For us that's been kind of perfect. We don't need to chill on the beach all day so we can go in the jungle, do a few little hikes and adventures and then just come to the beach in the evening and sort of relax which has been like the perfect balance. We've had a great time in Manuel Antonio. We hope you've enjoyed watching this video. We're also going to be leaving Costa Rica very soon. We're going to a new country for both of us and a new continent as well. So leave a comment down below if you can guess which country we're going to be going to next. You like this one? Give it a thumbs up and consider subscribing and we'll see you in a new country and a new adventure on the next video. Bye!
