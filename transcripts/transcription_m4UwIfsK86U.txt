With over 400 waterfalls packed into one tiny country, Costa Rica is a waterfall taser's dream and in this video we're taking you to one of the country's best waterfall destinations. We're Jamie and Skyler and we recently spent eight days road tripping through Costa Rica. Our first four days included a pretty epic hike. Look at these views that we got. And some amazing waterfalls. And since we just can't get enough of either, our fifth day in Costa Rica has more of both. We'll be hiking two miles each way to visit two more stunning falls. But before we get to that, we're gonna start this day at one of Costa Rica's most unique and beautiful beaches. Our day five beach destination takes us around seven miles south of the Vida to Ojochal. It's here on the Pacific Shoreline that you'll find Ply of Antanas and its famous beachfront caves. There's the water at low tide. The caves are over to the left which we'll get to and you can see the beach which is in line to be the previous palm trees. During high tide, this is all completely underwater and you can't even access the caves. Thankfully, we could learn how important it is to track the tides on our last trip to Costa Rica. So this time, we had arrived shortly after a morning low tide to be sure that we could walk into the caves. Of the two main caves at Ply of Antanas, the one further to the north is the largest and the one Skyler decided to explore first. Skyler is walking way into the cave. Alright, he's reached the water. Oh yeah, that's a snap. I don't know if you can see that little dot in the middle of the light, but I think Skyler is coming back out finally. Okay, so it's definitely switched and the tide is coming in. It didn't get near this holy crap. This is crazy how fast the tide comes in. The cave that lies further to the south is quite a bit smaller than the one to the north and is definitely not for those who are claustrophobic and although Skyler's not a huge fan of tight spaces, he decided to explore the cave anyway. While Skyler's risk appetite is much more than mine, he knew that his time in this cave was limited. As the waters in this cave can rise extremely fast, creating a very dangerous situation, even for strong swimmers. Eventually, Skyler decided the water was getting a little too high for his comfort and decided to join me out on the beach. I'm really glad we decided to come at low tide this time and at only $4 a million America, and I'd say this is a must visit. Back out on the beach, we were amazed to find we still had it nearly all to ourselves on this late Wednesday morning. And while we would have loved to stick around to enjoy it for a while, we had other places to be. The first of which was a Roma cafe, where we had already visited earlier for breakfast that morning and were extremely impressed. Now normally, we don't visit the same spot twice in one trip, but our coffees and passion fruit pastry at a Roma were so delicious, we just had to make a stopback for a lunch order to go. After 5 and honest, we decided to go back to the place where we had coffee at this morning because we enjoyed it so much and we did see that they had a pretty good lunch menu, but we are booking it now to Nyaka. So we couldn't stay, we got our food to go, we'll show you what it looks like. So we ended up getting two of these sandwiches and honestly for lunch, we probably could have gotten by with one. I don't think we had any idea how big they were. We ate all the fries, and now you can see the sandwich a little bit better. For what, six or seven bucks American? That's a great deal. By the time we grabbed our sandwiches and got back on the road, it was already around noon, and since we'd have a 40 minute hike both to and from the waterfall, and would have to be back to our vehicle by four, we knew we'd have limited time to enjoy the waterfalls, so we were in a hurry. I think really a couple minutes from the entrance to Nyaka Waterfalls, now we are going to the original, which is Don Lulos, that is less expensive if you're willing to hike both ways. After around a 15 minute drive northeast from Dominic Al, we reached the office, Rodan Lulos, where we purchased our tickets for $10 per person before driving another mile or so to the parking lot. To even though this road is nice and paved, it is super narrow. We would not want to meet anybody coming up at this time, but we're pretty sure by the time we're ready to come back up on this road, nobody should be driving down. I think they stopped letting people in the park after some point in the afternoon. I think parking for the day is $4 and the parking lot closes at four. Down here in the parking lot they do have restrooms and changing areas which is really nice. So we are just putting on sunscreen and staying in front of the AC as long as possible, because as soon as you step out of the car, you're like sweating immediately. It's going to be a very hot hike today, but think it'll be worth it to see the falls. Ready for our adventure, we begin the two mile hike to the waterfall, which began by crossing over the river and into the forest. So when you go to the original entrance, you can pay $10 USD per person plus $4 to park, or you can pay $30 per person, and you can take the trucks that drive up and down. And I think it might be just like a 10 minute hike to the falls, or you can pay I think $80 per person and ride horses. If you do like the $30 per person, I think that it's a limit of like two hours at the falls, which you know I think for most people that would be enough. So we're about a half mile into the hike to the falls, and this is our view at the moment. Very scenic. So there are a lot of really nice views on the side of this trail, but do keep in mind that there are horses on this trail as well. So make sure you don't spend too much time looking at the views because you'll probably step in horse boots. It does look like we're going to have nice signs along the way to let us know how far until the waterfall. And today we're hiking only four miles, which is much better than the six miles we've had two days ago. Now if you haven't already seen our hike up Pico Blanco, our morning at the whale's tail are crazy drive through the mountains, or our visits to several other coastal recon waterfalls. Be sure to check out the first two episodes in this series after this one. And if you want to be sure to not miss our final coastal recon episode, go ahead and subscribe to our channel and turn the notifications on. So we're here on a Wednesday. I think we started hiking around noon or maybe just a little bit after. And there are quite a few people hiking on the trail. We've reached our first choose your adventure portion of the trail. You take the bridge, or do you take the rocks? You taking the bridge? Yeah. All right, I'm taking the rocks. But this little slippery over there. Yeah, they were a little slippery. Also the rock route was longer. So far the hike has been very, very green. Again, we're here at the very end of rainy season. So this might be the greenest that it gets. One kilometer down, two to go. We're both getting pretty sweaty already. I don't know if it's so much different, like the time of year that you visit, because this trail mostly has been shaded for us. But when we had done this trail years ago, it would have been in May. And I remember the trail being mostly sunny. And it was pretty miserably hot. So it is significantly better this time around. So up ahead we see a bunch of horses. We're thinking it's probably the halfway point where you can stop and get some food and drinks. We're doing pretty good. I think we're just going to keep moving. Try to get to the falls as early as possible. So we can enjoy it for a few hours and still be to our Airbnb before sunset. As you can see, the option to take horses to the falls is pretty popular. So guys, this is probably the longest stretch of sun up ahead. So the bad thing about this super hot and humid weather is that it really saps the energy out of you. And it does make a hike that normally probably wouldn't be that bad. Pretty difficult, but the good thing about it is that cold waterfall is going to feel great once we get there. Oh, we got another bridge coming up. Skylar looks like you can walk through the water if you want to again. But I think I'm going to go over this bridge. You don't have to. You can join me on the bridge. Once again, Jamie chose the bridge. And I'm taking the rocks. Looks like pretty beautiful. I did not have taken the rock. If you don't want to get your feet wet, take the bridge. Don't take the rocks. Because even though they're pretty flat, they are covered in moss and you just slide right off them, getting close. As you can see, there's a few more people on the trail now. Those are the people that took the truck to get to the point where it's only a 10 minute hike to the waterfall. So that means we should have less than 10 minutes to go at this point. And after just a few more minutes on the trail, we had arrived at the boardwalk which leads to the falls where we found restrooms and changing rooms in a map with directions to the waterfalls. So the lower falls is where you can swim and cool off. So we're going to hit the upper falls first while we're hot and sweaty and then we'll go cool off into lower falls after that. I cannot believe how different this experience is. I know we were here several years ago, but this has changed so much. This full path was not here at all. After over two miles of hiking in the coast to wreak and heat, we had finally reached the upper waterfall and it was every bit as impressive as we had remembered. The falls dropped more than 170 feet before cascading an additional 85 feet down to the swimming area below. And while there may not be any spots for swimming at the upper falls, the mist from the falls is still a great way to cool down. Now if you aren't comfortable getting down close to the falls like Skylar, you can still experience the upper falls from this platform, which is far enough a way to keep you dry, but still close enough to have an amazing view. So it does look like if you go to the new entrance point, you get to explore the other side of the river and the waterfalls. So you will get a whole other view over there. It would be cool to go to both places. We can look up for waterfalls or into the lower falls. On our hike to the lower waterfall, we ran across these guys and while we're not quite sure what they are, they did seem to be friendly. We did have to climb down quite a few stairs to get to the lower waterfall, but the bay and the railing made reaching it pretty easy. At around 85 feet high, the lower falls is only about half as tall as the upper falls, but it's still quite impressive. And while the upper falls may not be good for swimming, the lower falls definitely is. And after four days of watching Skylar swim and chilly coast of reacon waters, I finally decided to take a swim myself. Oh, it's finally in. Oh my god, look at that view. It's a little bit to get used to this. I didn't feel really going to go. In addition to being an awesome spot for swimming, the lower falls is also a great spot to snap some photos. And since we had these falls almost entirely to ourselves, we took advantage of the opportunity. Now around three in the afternoon, it was about time to get going, but first, Skylar had to make an attempt at jumping off the waterfall. Unfortunately, he couldn't find the spot to climb up the falls, so we'd have to wait another day to get in his next jump. So we are on our way back from the falls. It is clouded over quite a bit, so it's a lot nicer walking back. But I think we're a little bit disappointed. Well, at least no Skylar is. We were too late for the guides to be on the falls. They kind of assist with people getting up on the waterfalls to jump off. They usually have a rope. And also, they just kind of show you where to go up. There was still a guide there that would kind of tell us how to get out to the area to jump off. But we had a bit of a language barrier. And I think by the time... There was a lot of pointing and going like this. Yeah, he was trying to help us out for sure. But by the time I think you'd figured out what he was actually trying to communicate to us. I still don't know exactly what he was saying. I just went out to the waterfall. Yeah. It takes so much energy just to get to the fall because of the current. Because normally, last time we were there that I was able to jump, they had a rope connected to an inner tube that they pulled out to the waterfall. And because they're such a current. So just getting out there was a challenge. I was pretty out of breath. By the time I made it to the waterfall. And then looking up and trying to find the spot where you climb up with all that water hitting you in the face. You're pretty much can't see anything. So I tried. But and I think we were like the last two of three people out of the waterfall so they were getting ready to shut down for the day. Otherwise, I have a feeling you probably would have rested a little bit. I would have kept trying. Yeah. Kind of ran out of time. Yep. So if you want to jump off of the waterfalls here, make sure to visit between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. They said that's whenever they usually have the ropes available to help. This hike back has been so much more enjoyable just because it feels so much cooler. So we have about a half mile to go to the parking lot and then we'll be on our way to our fourth Airbnb district. Yeah, we've already stayed in some pretty cool ones, but I think this one's probably gonna be our favorite. Well, our dry streak is over. We're finally getting caught in the rain. Fairly. It's only sprinkling so far. Yeah. It's probably gonna get heavier, but maybe we'll look out. We made it back to the green suspension bridge and right across that is the parking lot. We got like eight minutes to spare. We've had it a little close, but not too bad. Yeah. Maybe six minutes to spare. With the sun setting right around 5 p.m., we'd only have about an hour to get to our mountain Airbnb before dark. Thankfully, it was only a few miles away, but we knew the roads there would probably be bad. Plus, we still had to get groceries. Fortunately, this superplatinnyo wasn't far out of the way and had everything we'd need for our two nights in the mountains. As we expected, the rest of the drive to the Airbnb was pretty, but also a bit sketchy, and we were sure glad to be doing it in the daylight. Now, because the property was a little bit off the grid, our directions were primarily based off of landmarks, which is why we were especially happy to come across this waterfall. You found the waterfall, so we're going the right way. So this Airbnb host has some great instructions for how to get out here. We just went through a bamboo grove and a small waterfall was on our left. Okay, let's see what we're supposed to do next. The road turns right there. Hang on. Was there a way to turn it off? Thankfully, the mist turn didn't slow us down too much. So we did make it back to our Airbnb after going to the store, and there is still a little bit of light, but it is gorgeous here. Gosh, this place is up in the mountains, and it is very peaceful. While our fifth day in Costa Rica wasn't short on hiking or waterfalls, our sixth day in Costa Rica had even more of both.
