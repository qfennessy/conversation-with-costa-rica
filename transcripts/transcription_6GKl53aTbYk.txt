This is what Costa Rica looks like. Welcome back to Costa Rica! We're Eric and Sarah and we've been traveling through Latin America for the past year and we picked up some tips and tricks along the way. But our number one question before coming to Costa Rica is, was, should we rent a car and we've read very mixed reviews online so we wanted to investigate for ourselves and figure out whether it's worth it to rent a car in Costa Rica. So while we're here in Costa Rica we're traveling with Sarah's brother, his wife and their 11 month old son. So we've rented a car for the next three weeks just to see for ourselves what it's like. Later in this video we'll be showing a lot of pros and cons, we'll share the costs, we'll share who we went with. But for right now our goal is to show you our experience of whether or not it's worth it for you to rent a car in Costa Rica. So let's get started. Oh by the way before we get going if you're not subscribed to our channel make sure to do that now because in every country we go to we show you a series of videos called the month in and we always share helpful tips about where to go, what you should do and how to do it, how much things cost. So you don't want to miss any of our Costa Rica videos so make sure to subscribe right now. So we don't really describe ourselves as purely budget travelers however I think whenever somebody's traveling just about everybody's on a budget. So when we flew from Guatemala to Costa Rica it was actually cheaper for us to fly into San Jose rather than Liberia even though Liberia is closer to the coast where we were trying to go and it was cheaper for us to go into San Jose however the opposite was true for Jeremy and Lauren. So we'd actually ended up renting a car and going from San Jose to Liberia took us about four hours and now we've been spending some time here on Plyzo Coco and it's beautiful right here we're just sitting here for sunset and I think we have Sarah way over there on the beach doing something. Doing some sort of Sasquatch walk. It's already time to say goodbye to Plyzo Coco we just picked up our new SUV for rental for the next couple weeks and since there's four of us we have so much stuff and I don't know if we got in a big enough vehicle to be honest because it's like absolutely packed to the gills but we're on a way to Santa Teresa and it's time to go. Ready to go Sarah? Woohoo! Road trip! Real quick let me tell you about the sponsor of this video which is Skillshare.

So we've had a rental car for about a week now and one of the major pros that we've realized is just the freedom we have to be able to just do whatever we want in the day. For example today we actually went on a day trip here from Santa Teresa to Montezuma waterfall and we were just able to go on our own and explore the waterfall for as long as we wanted not have to figure out any sort of transportation to get there and back and even here in Santa Teresa it's kind of spread out so it's nice to have a car to be able to even go and get groceries or explore different beaches. So that's been a major pro for us it's just having the freedom to not have to sort out like any sort of bus taxi or those kind of things it's just nice to be able to go where you want when you want and yeah not have to feel bad even if it's just a little trip for like half an hour you know but a con that we've realized is that you kind of need to have a plan for your whole trip and we're not really used to that we're used to just kind of planning as we go but we've realized that if you if you don't kind of have most of your trip planned out then the car can often end up just sitting for days at a time if you're not using it and we've noticed that especially in these beach towns sometimes we just feel like spending the whole day at the beach so the car doesn't get used but you can't really rent a car for like two days on and two days off and keep returning and getting a new one if that makes sense so you kind of have to just be prepared to commit having it for the whole length of your trip if that makes sense so just something to take into consideration if you decide whether to rent a car or not. Well today's road trip includes driving from Santa Teresa all the way to Monteverde and you can definitely tell that we're here in the dry season because it's a lot more dead and brown but at the further we get and closer we get to Monteverde the more green it gets we're climbing up through the mountains and it is so so beautiful this drive is amazing okay we were getting really nervous on the coast because we found out it was the dry season and honestly everything was super brown and we were really nervous that we weren't going to see any green but now that we're here in Monteverde seriously this is insane like this is so much green this is the Costa Rica that we came for so now that we're in the mountains we're really going to be able to test whether or not it was worth it for us to rent a car here in Costa Rica because when we were on the beach there was a lot more down days and a lot more beach days whereas here in the mountains things are more spread apart so really you're going to be going on a lot more day trips like to hear into the Santa Elena cloud forest so so beautiful we're just on a bridge over some water so nice this is so amazing just happy to be here so we're here in La Fortuna we've actually been here for a week now and my parents and one of my sisters joined us and they decided to rent a car as well this beautiful sedan nice guy but yeah they've been driving around in the car all week and have we've had no issues like meaning a 4x4 so if you're renting a car here don't worry that you need 4x4 because most of the roads are really good the clearance of our other SUV is a little bit nicer for the big potholes but you can totally get by with just a car in any place that we visited so far so driving in Costa Rica is really quite simple I would say it's comparable to driving back home really like I know some people are maybe scared to drive in Latin American countries because they hear the roads are crazy but everyone drives pretty normal like it's not really that crazy maybe every so often you have someone who passes you on a corner but you know what that happens sometimes at home too and maybe also certain areas are a little bit more narrow like when we were driving up to Monteverde super narrow and windy but you really just got to take your time and really if you're a confident driver it's not that difficult so after having the car for about three weeks I think we can confidently say that it is well worth it for at least for us to have rented a car there's four of us and a baby and it's been really nice to not have to search out price out and book different shuttles or buses and honestly for us it's been super nice not to have to walk around with our backpacks on our front and our back just to just to get around we can just throw it in the car and we're good to go so for us because there's four of us it's totally worth it and the biggest thing that we would recommend is to book your rental cars early we rented our car about two months in advance and it came out to 72 dollars a day and we have now since booked another car because of the freedom and independent set that we like to have now here in Costa Rica I never thought I would hear ourselves it now it's about a hundred dollars a day because we booked it later so it's a difference of about thirty dollars so again it kind of depends on your budget if there's one or two of you maybe it's not so worth it but because there's been four of us you know we've been able to split it and it's been okay so if you made it this far in the video you're probably wondering so how do we actually rent a car in Costa Rica and where should we rent from so if you come to Costa Rica it's often one of the biggest problems here is that people feel like they get scammed by car companies and the main reason this happens is because they'll go through some big company online and then when they get here to Costa Rica they end up having way more charges put on top so even for my parents they originally got a quote from a different company and it was gonna end up being almost twice as much when they actually arrived here because in Costa Rica there is a there is a mandatory car insurance that has to be added onto your thing no matter what your credit card covers a lot of people get here and then they feel like they get scammed which is what you definitely want to avoid so after doing a bunch of research we ended up finding a guy named Hiro and he has this company called Carrentals Costa Rica and USA and we'll link it below for you and this is not a promotion for him or anything we are not getting sponsored by him we just actually really love his services so his whole thing is that there's no hidden fees so if you rent a car from him he'll give you a quote and when you show up here the price that he gave you is the price you pay and we have now rented four different cars here and we can attest to that being true so it's really nice and it's really nice that we've been able to have him available when we need to call someone we've had a couple issues with our cars and we've he's been able to just like contact them what's that we don't have to deal with anything we literally just text him or call him and say hey something's not working out yeah says a kl call you back in 20 minutes and in 20 minutes it's solved yeah it's pretty sweet so nice to have somebody like on the ground that's right help you at any point so we highly recommend looking into his services if you're gonna rent a car here he does work alongside alamos you end up renting a car through alamo but he's able to get you the best price and yeah one thing we would say is definitely regardless of this just always make sure to check your receipts and check everything on your reservations we had a couple times where we showed up and the dates are wrong or a few things are wrong in the charge that we got on our credit card so always just check all those things but otherwise this is a great great way to not feel like you get scam and Costa Rica well the time has come to finally return our rental car the last one for the rest of our trip we're gonna be using the buses which the one bonus of navigating the buses in public transportation is you do get to interact with a lot more locals so we are excited for that party that's right but it's been super nice to be able to rent a car at least for the first few weeks of our trip here especially because we've been traveling with family as well like we said with Sarah's brother and sister and their baby we've been able to go around really easily and they haven't had to navigate buses or anything so for us it's totally been worth it to rent a car yeah definitely with four people hundred percent worth it i would say yeah and if you have any questions about renting a car and so straight up please let us know in the comments we'd love to hear what you thought of this video and if you have further questions we'll be answering them there that's right we'll see in the next one why why your car so many angles girls
