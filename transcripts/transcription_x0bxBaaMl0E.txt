What's going on island hopper today we're coming to you from Tamarindo Beach in the Pacific coast of Costa Rica let's begin. So Tamarindo is located in the Guana Costa province in the northern part of Costa Rica just south of Papagayo Gulf another really popular place with luxury travelers in Costa Rica so what we're going to do in this Tamarindo beach travel guide show you guys around the beach the town show you where we stayed also take you out on a booze cruise. This beach here is popular with surfers because of the strong currents also a voting community exists here as you can see with all the boats off the shore and people like to do horseback riding I'm not too sure how I feel about that since you know what the horses do on the beach. So while we were sitting down having breakfast I ended up buying this hat obviously for about 20 U.S. dollars I think it's a good value but one thing I will say is we ended up booking a tour to go out on a catamaran sometimes they call it a booze cruise I don't know if they're going to sell on this a booze cruise but it includes snorkeling we're going to go out there have some fun that ended up costing $80 per person if I wanted to pay using a credit card it was going to be $95 so having cash on you does pay around here. Before we go out on that sunset cruise let's take a walk around the town show you what it looks like here in the actual neighborhood if you guys watch my other video about the downtown walking tour you guys can go back and watch it if you haven't already seen it but I really highlighted this downtown area in that video so we're just having some drinks before we're getting ready to go out on the catamaran it's a chilly motto you give it to me for free so here we are on Plya Tamarindo which obviously translates to Tamarindo Beach if you look back over here you can see the restaurants right up against the ocean here some hotels but most of the hotels are actually going to be back up the hill bit which is good in case there's a tsunami by but where we're actually headed now is on a catamaran headed out to the ocean del mar we're going to go around this point did you see right over here and then we're going to go to a private beach snorkel for about an hour or so but we're going to have a lot of fun you guys are going to love this one so stay around already let's do this you know on these kind of sunset cruises they say going out there people are kind of relaxed but on the way back they're really partying this crew that we went out with everybody was having fun on the way out and on the way back so this was a pretty lit crew right here but it's also probably because we left at 12 o'clock in the afternoon so so so See we made it to the shore. I use these floaties, you don't need them but I'm such a, you know, worry-ward. I wear them anyway, just in case, you know, high tide or something. But you made it to this beach, check it out.

I got mixed veggies and mashed potatoes. So this is a fresh lobster straight out of Costa Rica. Let's dive in. Here's a look at the hotel we stayed at. It was $100 a night. You stayed two nights here, but it was a doll's only. So after being in some resource with lots of kids screaming, hanging out at the pool, I was ready for an adult only pool for sure. Also really good for working and getting things done. So we're going to use these floaties. So we're going to use these floaties. So we're going to use these floaties.

So after a few days in Tamarindo, pleasant relaxing days, by the way, we decided to head down to the Nikoia Peninsula. So you'll want to stick around for the next one because we're going to be coming to you from La Sanzita, Santa Teresa down there on the Nikoia Peninsula. This is also to work in the island. But this is Tamarindo. Real nice town. Just south of Papagayo Golf. Hope you guys enjoyed it. We'll see you on the next one.
