Travel with me to Costa Rica for the first time ever. We began our journey landing in San Jose. We then hopped on a shuttle and made our way to La Jordona. It is our first day of Costa Rica. The drive is a little crazy, but roads are super bumpy and it's going to take us two hours to get there. You guys are at the Airbnb. We made it to the hotel. Two hours later, we're in La Jordona. It was a long way. We spent the entire morning driving. It is now 12 p.m. I'm so excited. There's so much we want to do, but the first thing is going out to eat because I'm starving. It is so hot. But I love it. The weather feels so good and we're going to change outfits. This is the before. Here's the outfit of today. I have a little bikini under. It's hot. This is our first time going out. We came to this little restaurant called Padquilla, Los Angeles. There's little chickens and dogs running around. One of the most popular spots in La Jordona is the La Jordona waterfall, which was the first spot that we decided to visit. I was having a moment of gratefulness. I decided to whip out my journal, which I was carrying with me everywhere throughout this trip. I literally was writing down how I thrive when I'm in nature. I belong in a forest, eating berries, being surrounded by cute animals. We are back at the hotel. Since we started our day at pretty late today, we're pretty tired now. I could honestly go to sleep, but I'm determined to soak out and do more stuff. I kind of got ready again. Put on a new outfit. I don't know if I mentioned this already, but we are going to be here for a whole week. I've been putting together a little bucket list. My Costa Rica bucket list. Activities that I hope to do while I'm here. It's good. We're walking around trying to look for a little grocery store. We're walking out on the streets by ourselves. I'm currently in a natural fox place. This is so dirty. It actually feels so feeling in nature. You guys have no idea how grateful I am to be here. I'm currently sitting on the side of the road. I fell and scraped myself. Next on our agenda, we're going to be heading to the Arrino volcano. It's like a little hike, but we're actually going to be taking horses on the way up. I'm so excited because riding horses was on our bucket list. I destroyed my bag and my hat. So I'm going to see the Arrino. It's already different from the Arrino, but it's very similar. Okay. We're going to go back to the bus. Once we made it to the top of the mountain with our horsey, which was such a vibe. We got off and hiked the rest of the way up to go to the school spot where we got a good view of the Arrino volcano. We made it to the volcano. Okay, no. We're going to the volcanic rocks. Before the day end, one last thing we wanted to do in my fortuna is go to the rope swing where you basically jump off of the rope into the water. And I feel like that's an iconic thing that you have to do here. And it's free. So hopefully we get to go do that before I get to start. I got so dark for finally leaving. We did some late night swimming at this river where you can jump off of a rope. And I jumped off quite a few times. It was so fun. Everyone told us that the water would be cold. But because of the adrenaline, once I jumped in, you couldn't even feel it. It literally felt warm. And it felt so good. So that night, we ended up doing a little road trip to Huckle, which was about a four-hour drive. To the left we have the cute little kitchen. We have all of our stuff here, but this is the dining table in the center. There's some bunk beds. I cannot. And then over here we have the bathroom. We just got some assayables and we're going to head to the beach. We're starting our morning in Huckle Beach. I definitely want to explore all the beaches around the area. I have all of my beach assembly laid out. I brought my book with me. And today's just going to be more of a relaxation day, which is much needed. Because after spending the last two days being an adventure girly, doing a bunch of crazy stuff, which just left me feeling so dead. Like, my knee is scratched up. I feel sore. My ankles are bruised. But yeah, let's see how today goes. What's up, guys? I'm going to the beach. I'm going to the beach. Thank you. Okay, we just went out the whole morning at the beach and we went about to the hotel. We're ending today at this restaurant called Ida de Mosa. We're watching the sunset while eating. Sit. Okay, Pa. Hello. I'm going to the sunset. This morning after breakfast, we went from Haco to Mano Antonio, which is only an hour drive. We're in our new Airbnb. We're only going to be here for a day. We've just been all over the place. I want to make the most of this trip. So we've just been hopping around from town to town. I'm starting to wish that I would have planned better for this trip. I was trying to find stuff to do last minute. We realized that there's this really cool national park. We can go to in this area, but we're not going to be able to go. Instead, we were able to find a tour that's actually going to take us on a little boat. To go through a river where we can see monkeys and sloths and a bunch of cute animals, which I'm excited for. We already made a huge mess. This is the view. How cramped. This is a kelp print cat. He loves me. Yes, I'm yellow back at cats. He intruded. Okay. It's pretty cool. It's like a garden inside. It's like a precarious garden. It's so hard to find a good one. After the boat tour, we walked around this little farm. I said hi to the animals. They then took us to Gogget dinner as a part of our tour to this restaurant and the center of Manuela Antonio. We just finished a six hour ride from Manuela Antonio to Puerto Viejo. We're officially here. This is going to be our last location. We're going to be here for the last couple days that we're going to be here in Costa Rica. It's one of the locations I was most excited for. And this time we're staying at a house. Look at how pretty she is. We're surrounded by the sounds of nature. So they have this outdoor area. They have the cutest canopy. There's literally butterflies flying around. This outdoor kitchen. Then here we have the main kitchen. The bed. I cannot get over. How cute this bathroom is. Like look at this bathtub. We're getting ready to go biking to the beach. We were told that in Puerto Viejo that's how a lot of people get around since everything is really close to each other. And I'm pretty excited. I'm obsessed with the bracelet I bought here. This moon stone. It promotes creativity and helps calm the mind. It's as intuition dreams plus energy. I've realized that there is no point in wearing makeup. There's a little lip balm from Fenty Beauty. This is the outfit of the day. Also this dress does not want to zip. The zipper is fully stuck. But the dress is so cute. That's why I want to wear it. Come over here. We just finished biking to Puerto Viejo. We got into my bathing suit. The water is so clear here. Sand is super light and it is such a vibe. I've been dripping in sweat and I can't wait to get in the water. I'm going to try to get underwater footage. I'm going to try to get underwater footage. I'm going to try to get underwater footage. Hello. We're back in the Airbnb. Check out my tan. Also my face is red. But it looks kind of cute. We spent the morning at the beach, picked up some fruits, missed the light-laws in the other room. I'm tempted to take a nap as well. But I feel like that is not the move. I want to be able to take in every second that I'm here. I've been wanting to try all of the fruit out here. For something we've noticed about all of the food is that everything is so much less sugary out here. The usual things I would drink in the US, which is so does. Any type of juices, they all taste so different. It's like their lacking sugar. But it's a good thing. I don't know if I'm crazy, but I feel like even the fruits are a lot juicier. I just finished taking a shower right now. I changed to an outfit. Something I had realized about myself on this trip is that I am such an adventurer currently. I feel like when most people go on trips, they just want to relax. And then I'm over here being the complete opposite. And I just want to be out adventuring. I want to go explore everything. I want to do every activity possible. And I don't know if I mentioned this already, but literally this whole trip was so spontaneous. I did not plan anything before coming here. Which is kind of bad. I don't recommend that. That definitely just made things more stressful. Anyways. Mmm, it's so juicy and sweet. So yummy. I'm at the pineapple juice. Oh my god. We drove to a nearby waterfall. Literally just had to go down some steps. And it's called the Brebury waterfall. We got pizza. We were going to try to watch the sunset and eat pizza, but we kind of missed it. We're still going to go though, because it's right there. Oh. Today's our last day in Costa Rica. And today's going to be a no-phone day. Which is a good thing and a bad thing. Bad thing because I got water in my phone yesterday. Which I'm so terrified because that my phone isn't working. Like it ended up dying. And now it just won't charge. Which is such an issue. I'm terrified because literally all of my pictures are on there. And I've been vlogging a lot on my phone. So if this video ends up going up, then everything's okay. But I'm sure I'll be fine. I'm just going to have to let my phone dry today. Technically yesterday was a no-phone day too. Since my phone stopped working yesterday. We're going to have time to go catch the sunrise. This probably will be our last beach moment. Since it is supposed to rain today. There's even a chance of thunderstorm. But I'm kind of excited for that. Since I haven't gotten to experience the rain here yet. Also, we were terrified last night. Because a whole bunch of insects started appearing. There's literally one right there, daring at me. There was lizards crawling around, centipedes, and we were terrified that they were going to crawl on us at night. I officially got my first bug bite. It's just surprising that I didn't get sooner. I feel like that's totally expected though in Costa Rica. That you're probably going to encounter creepy big insects in your home. This is the hairstyle we're going with today. I'm starting to give up on my hair. This is as good as it's going to get. Look at that beautiful forest. Oh, a flyer cook this? Yeah. Okay. We're at the beach now and we brought some snacks. This is so good. It started raining. It's raining hard. We're coug. We're coug. No way. It's raining. This is our first official rain experience. I love how I'm just always constantly pouring sweat. Even when it's raining outside, we're going to be heading to the heart of Puerto Villal. And get some breakfast. Today we're actually doing a little chocolate tour, which I'll explain more later. But that should be interesting because those are super popular here. I feel like I would have been sad if we didn't do one at some point. Also, there's not a lot of ubers in Puerto Villal. So we're going to have to go ask somebody to see how to get a taxi, how transportation works around here. I know there's also buses and stuff, but I have no idea how those work. So we're going to go figure it out. The roads are so crazy here. It'll literally go front and meant to just pure rocks and dirt. It's just one of the reasons that I decided to not rent a car because I would not trust myself. Look at that. I'm going to help get a taxi or go find one. Where are you going to find one? Where are you going to find the bus? This is cute. It always works. We're going to go to the restaurant, but we have a number. We noticed this flea market that of course we had to go and explore. I thought it was cute how so many people were there selling their own clothes from home. We ended up doing some shopping and we're going to be heading to the chocolate tour. I told you about earlier. Since Costa Rica is mostly known for their chocolate and coffee, I really wanted to go on one of their chocolate tours. In this tour, I got to learn about how to grow chocolate from start to finish. The lady showed us her cacao trees, how she grows them. Once we made the chocolate, we got to taste it. She even made us some hot chocolate, which was not my favorite, but the chocolate was okay. This was overall a fun learning experience. I think it's always interesting to learn more about the agriculture and economies of the country that you're visiting. The last thing we did this night was go get dinner. I had so much fun in Costa Rica. Thank you guys for supporting my channel because if it wasn't for you, these two travel vlogs would not exist. I love you guys so much and see you next week.
