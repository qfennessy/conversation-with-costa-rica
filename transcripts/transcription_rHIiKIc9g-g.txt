Hello, today's video. If you're coming to Costa Rica, please don't do the following things. So please, I thought I'd do this video, so hopefully you watched this before you come down. And these series of don'ts will either save you money, save your time, help you out somewhere else. So here we go, let's get into it. You should definitely rent a car, get out, travel around the country, see some nice things. So please don't rent those tiny normal, silent cars, get a small SUV. And not necessarily because you're going to be going off-road, but the loads of pop holes in this country and when you're parking, you're always parking on a virgin going up. So really you need ground clearance and you need good size tires. There's little tires on the cheapest rental cars that blow out on the slightest thing, slightest little pop hole. And you do not want to be on the side of the road trying to change a tire. So that would be my number one don't. These don't pay for everything in dollars. The currency of the country is the Colón. The name comes from Christopher Colón, which is another name for Christopher Columbus. So everything is based in the Colón, even though they've presented to you in dollars. The big ticket items like your hotel, renting your car will be in dollars. Pretty much everything else, but you can try to play in Colón as because if you pay in dollars, the exchange rate will be in their favour. And it might be massively in their favour. I mean, the exchange rate when I'm doing this video is about 6, 10, 6, 15. Some of the modes that don't get the exchange rate are 500. So you're losing 20% by paying in dollars. So I'd always have Colón as now. Please don't change your money in the airport. It's a complete and utter ripoff. Pretty much. When if you go into any bank, they've all got very similar rates, the normal banks. And that's the best place to change US dollar notes into Colón as. The other alternative is to draw money out on your credit card. I would always select Colón as. So then it comes up on your credit card in Colón as and then whatever your credit card company at home doesn't exchange rate that's generally the point. Don't try to see too much in one trip. When you're planning a trip, you've got a map of Costa Rica and it looks like from one place to the next it's about an inch. It seems that every trip takes four hours here. The roads are not the best. They're sort of windy little country roads and pop holy and then you want to stop off and see things on the way. So travel between one destination and the next always takes longer than you're planning. So if your trip is bum bum bum bum bum you're not really stopping to smell the roads and enjoy the place. I would say spend at least two nights in every destination and if it's one you think you're going to love spending spend three nights and then also you're not under stress to be getting to your destination because Costa Rica roads you just got to take your time and not rush and not speed because around the next bend they're going to be cows on the road or a big old pop hole we need to swerve around. There are so many amazing things to see in this country but maybe just in your first trip down here plan to see a few things and then think why are you going to be coming back in the year because everybody falls in love with it and everybody comes back. Don't be fooled when you're going to restaurants with their menu and their bills. Generally whatever you see on the menu they're going to add 30% sales tax and a 10% tip and that 10% tip by law goes to the service it's not for the restaurant. So whatever you, whatever price you see on the menu you know that there's going to be a 23% added to that when you get the check. If you see it itemized which it has to be by law they'll say 30% sales tax fair enough and then they won't say they'll say tax service tax or something like they'll try to get the word tax into it so you think it's just a tax rather than the government enforce 10% obligatory tip that goes to the staff. So people tend to be there to the amount of the menu comes to them with an extra 20, 23% added on and then they'll give another 20% tip so then your budget goes goes over the top. Leave whatever tip you feel comfortable with. A normal Costa Rica going to a restaurant and then we'll probably leave a few coins or a dollar or two extra and that's what the servers are normally expecting. Don't come without WhatsApp download it onto your phone. Everybody uses WhatsApp as their primary means of communication. But no Costa Rica is ever going to be sending you a text or calling your North American number. If you don't know WhatsApp is what the rest of the world uses apart from North America to communicate and it's a free app. So for example if you're waiting on the side of the road for your driver and he's late which they usually are. If you have his WhatsApp number say hey wait where are you and he says oh I'm 20 minutes away then you can go get a cup of coffee and he knows on his way and you're absolutely fine. If you're relying on emails or whatever he will not be communicating with you and you'll just be standing there on the side of the road. Absolutely it is the number one way of communicating so I really encourage you to download that. Don't buy property on your first trip down here and that might seem strange coming from me but really I think the best way to do it is take your time. People get a little bit of a fever they first come down here because everything is so amazing and so even if your attention is to buy a property down here I just take your time. Most people come down in the high season the first trip absolutely falling in love with it and my recommendation is always just go home think about it plan a trip down here in the lower season where everything's much cheaper the weather's different. Look at it with fresh eyes and the second time you'll come down you'll feel like you're a bit of an expert because you've got connections and you've the people you've found on the first trip and you'll be welcome back and you'll start to feel part of the community. My interest is you find something that's right for you for the long term. The people that buy here end up becoming my neighbours and my friends so I really want everybody to make a very good decision as to where and how much they want to spend and if Costa Rica is really for them. And this one's for me as well as as everybody don't fall in love with a Costa Rican girl. Costa Rican girls are amazing, beautiful, friendly, lovely, hot, passionate, Latina. But they're not the most painful people in the world. I say that would love. There's Joker, the Costa Rican girl walks into hallmark a few days before Valentine's days, says to the guy do you have a card that says when I met you I was just an innocent girl. You taught me everything that I know, you fulfilled me. I want to spend the rest of my life with you and the whole mob goes, guy goes, well yeah actually I do have a card that says exactly that and she says great, give me five of them please. Now it's a bit harsh and I've got good friends that are very happy married to Costa Rica and for many many years and they've got families and everything worked perfectly but all I'd say is just don't brush into things just take your time. Don't pay too much in bribes to get out traffic fines. Now it's illegal to pay bribes, you could get to trouble so take care but every policeman I've ever met ends up asking for one and it seems to be the normal thing to do so just go into this with your eyes open. Generally in Costa Rica you're paying people to either do their job better or faster or do their job worse and so if you get stopped for speeding or not wearing a seatbelt or anything like that this is the way it will go. So they'll come up to you and the guy will be very stern and you've done this wrong, you've done that wrong and that means the fines are going to be $500 or whatever the number is in Colones. We're going to take your car away and you're not going to be able to leave the country until you've gone to court and you're going oh my god this is really terrible, it's really terrible. And then you float out something oh my goodness you know is there any way we can settle this now? I'm doing on the spot fire and he'll go and he'll get his book out and as soon as he starts to actually write the fine out then then it's a point of no return because he has to fill that in if he's got half filled out one but what he tends to do is lick his pen and hold his book like that and then maybe you'll flip over to a blank sheet of paper and to start to write your name down or something and then at that point you know you're in the negotiating cycle and often when you're going through because you're fairly tens you're thinking oh my god that's your founder the only honest cop in in the country but it's all part of negotiation and then he'll say well you know we really shouldn't because by the way the police if they get caught they get to a lot of trouble it's just they never see if you get caught because it's so normal and then he'll say well your fines should be $500 if you give me $200 then we'll move on now any Costa Rica that gets stopped he's paying $10 $5 as a foreigner $20 is a lot but so you just could then go into your charming self-effacing you know really I can't you know I've just spent this and I've only got this much and I need to go and get petrol and then get dinner for my wife who's pregnant and whatever it is and then you just start the negotiation and then your hand is booking and like with his fingers underneath and then you just sort of slot the note into there and then then you give your passport back and everything and wish you on your on your way take a lot of care with that you know it's it's the normal way of what Costa Rica is normally doing a traffic stop and it'll probably give you your best anecdote of your whole trip but just going to the ISO. Don't come to Costa Rica without planning your internet connection I know it sounds horrible you're here to enjoy the beaches and the jungles and things but really having a consistent internet connection is going to make your life so much easier people that come down here and neither rely on hotel Wi-Fi or they're paying by the hour of their internet connection so they only have a connective for a few minutes a day or whatever every interaction you have with your booking or fishing trip or your driver to take you to Mamma Antonio or whatever you're doing you're going to need that constant interaction most North American carriers they'll do a package where you can come and hold a and you're covered in Costa Rica so that's your easiest one second as long as you've got an unlocked phone you can buy a Costa Rica chip probably for $10 you can get a card you slot it into your phone and then you're covered for your your whole period down here so one way or another I really recommend you figure that out before you come down here don't use Google Maps use Waze Waze at E Waze is like an intelligent version of Google Maps that gets feedback in real time from other people on the same road as you at the head of you so for example if there's an accident ahead then it will update your app in real time and calculate a different route for you it's really amazing and even if you're on a back road in the middle of the night in the middle of Costa Rica and also just really trust Waze every time when Waze is telling me to go one way and after 20 years ago no no no I know that the other way is better sure enough if I don't follow Waze something's happened the road blocked or the tree in the road or something like that the back road here are really back roads so you know you might if you're finding a shortcut on the map and Waze is sending you a different way it's almost always for a reason it could be a really rough road I trust Waze that's always the way for me to get to my destination as quick as possible so it's just it just really works very well so please if you find out any of this useful please click below like subscribe and get an alert so you get notified when the next one's coming out and it also gives me a little boost and I know that people are really you know interested in when I see those excellent BPPB we're subscribed tonight gives me an extra little boost and it makes me feel like it's worthwhile to be spending my time sharing my experiences and trying to help you to have a better time during your stay in the industry
