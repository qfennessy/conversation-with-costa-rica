Hey everyone and welcome back to the Travels channel. My name is Dylan. Today I'm going to be taking you through 15 things that I wish I knew before Costa Rica or before coming to Costa Rica. And there's quite a lot of things that would make your trip so much easier, better, and just some great things to know. So I'm going to start off this list right in here in this lovely national park area. By the water it's crystal blue. I don't know if you guys can see this is absolutely insane. So first things first, when you're coming to Costa Rica if you're traveling through America regardless of if you're stopping over for a day or not you need an ester. An ester you basically pay $20 and they approve your form which is saying like you're not going to do any damage or work in the US and you basically need that ester to get through boarding and customs in the UK without that you can't fly to Costa Rica via the US or anywhere in the anywhere through the US really. Now the second thing on the list is to be careful if you're renting a car to ensure that there is a spare tire on the back of the car because sometimes in the roads they can be very, very bumpy. There can be a lot of stones. It's fairly common to have your tires slashed in Costa Rica apparently. We got a flat tire on our very first day of the trip. Still unsure whether it was slashed in the very first day because it was extremely flat or whether the roads in Montezumore are just so, so bumpy that it gave us a flat tire. But it only costs seven quid to get fixed at the local garage and it didn't happen to us again. Despite driving on the same roads lots and lots and lots so it could have been smashed as a common thing. But make sure your car rental comes with a spare tire as you might need it. Secondly, again, whenever you're hiring a surfboard, a car, whatever it is, make sure as the tip number three that you film everything to do with that rental because they might try and charge you for stuff that isn't your problem. Also the car might have been damaged before you got it but you might need to prove that it was damaged before you got it. Same for the surfboard, same for all of that sort of stuff. So make sure you film everything before you hire it out. Make sure as well you bring a lot of money because Costa Rica is very expensive. Kinder Bueno in Liberia is £3,1800, which is insane. However, I also was able to get a T-shirt, a nice fake T-shirt to be fair, a night one for £1,200. So some elements like the food and drinks are very expensive and other elements like you can find some cheaper stuff but it's way more expensive than I ever realised. Make sure you bring a lot of bug spray for tip number five because the bugs are everywhere. Number six, often if people are ever trying to help you with it being a tour guide or trying to help you fix your tire or something like that, they often want money for it so be careful that they're not just helping you to put money. So apparently we got told that if somebody offers to help you a tire, a change of tire, they might be trying to rob you by the car rental place so they told us that. So watch out for those sort of things. Now another thing to know, number seven is going to be that on a Tuesday, if you're going to Montezuma or someone like that, stuff can seem kind of closed. And we also found that as well as a Tuesday, I guess, to them right now is that on a Friday, Montezuma in the local nightlife was absolutely zero. However, on a Saturday, it was completely popping off so make sure you do a lot of research into what days pop off when it comes to nightlife. The bus is in Costa Rica. They come very, very, you know, sporadically at tip number nine. So tip number nine is whenever you're trying to find something out, the internet is not as reliable as it would be in the places of the world like UK, America. Often the best thing to do is to go up to people and ask them because if you ask them, the locals, they know everything like the spot right now. I mean, I was going to go somewhere else, but I asked one of the locals at the hostel and they recommended this place to me and I do not regret it at all. It's absolutely insane. So asking people is the best way to find out about buses, to find out about where to go and all of those sort of things. There are buses that take you all over Costa Rica, but the times are very sporadic and they can hurry you onto one bus to the next bus. And it can get a bit crazy. So make sure you keep all your valuables on you and in yourself all times because it will get hectic. And I've got five more tips, but I want to make sure we do these at the actual waterfall. So let's get going. 10 minutes and I'm already being rinsed by bugs. And another tip for sure is that if you're going to a pond or a lake or something like that, bring loads more bikes, pray than you think you would need because I was finding Monty Zuma, Santa Teresa by the beaches by the surfing places, but as soon as you get around here to the local inland, ponds and national parks, the bugs for me are moving crazy. They're literally packing me, but yeah, here's what I'd also say tip number 11 in Costa Rica. The beaches are great. I think most of our holidays are the beaches and stuff like that, but having come to Liberia, but I just think how stunning some of the inland places are. Like I've now realized that don't get caught up with amazing beaches and whatnot because the beaches are great, but I think the stuff like this, you cannot find this many other places in the world where there are a lot of nice beaches everywhere. So don't just get caught up in the beaches. Unless let's go to this waterfall and go for a swim. It is lovely. And I like it because although I had to do a slight bit of a trek to get down here, then a slightly off-half route, that was an arrow, but I came down a bit further to find this lovely seafood a bit of a wonderful, so worth it, man. So that first part I just showed you seems to be in the middle of the car park area behind the tubes. Now I've turned right on all the way down the car park and I'm following a new path. And this one might take me to some caves apparently, someone had said to me. So I'm going to try and find these caves. If you're a good swimmer, apparently you can swim. And then at the top end there is the main waterfall. So I'm doing it in reverse orderish. So let's go check this out. So maybe this is the main waterfall. I think there's so much of this waterfall that you can access. Look at this. Wow. And up here, this is insanely nice man. Look at this. Then let's get in. It's not quite a hot swim. It has to hang this. It's quite hot to swim, man. This is all for the challenge, child. Leave a like if you want to. Travels challenge, this is it. We're just getting my phone out. And if I'm busy. Now it's lovely. My skull's all the way up to the waterfall so I showed you earlier on. And these are the caves. I think there's a waterfall somewhere further up as well. Thank you.
